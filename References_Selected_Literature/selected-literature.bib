   abstract = {IoT devices are various types of hardware such as appliances, sensors, machines, or actuators that are programmed for specific applications such as data transmission over a network or the Internet. They are embedded in other industrial devices, biological sensors, mobile devices, and medical devices. There are approximately 7.62 billion people in our world, with a growing graph of IoT devices. So, the amount of data released from these IoT devices also increases, and there may be a chance of leakage of data from these devices. These IoT devices used in our home is exposed to different types of attacks like eavesdropping, brute force attack, leakage of information, cyber attacks etc. In detecting these types of attacks the machine learning algorithms play an important role and which improves the security of these IoT devices and help in making these IoT devices more secure; that is the primary goal of this project. Machine learning models can help in finding the spam in the data. Smart home datasets are available, which includes different weather conditions is used for finding spam. The main models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Time Series and Recurrent Neural Network are used in finding the spam in the dataset.

   abstract = {The rise of the internet of things (IoT) popularity with smart home systems and improvements in the technologies of embedded devices raised interest in such solutions. However, with the increase in the utilization of these technologies, the security risks increased as well. Connecting a large number of devices to the same network is risky, because the security of any network is only as strong as its weakest part, and in the case of IoT the weakest link can be a small home appliance. This research aims to improve the means for detecting and preventing attacks on such networks via a hybrid method between machine learning and population-based metaheuristics. The proposed study introduces an enhanced version of the recently emerged sine cosine algorithm (SCA) that was used for tuning extreme learning machine (ELM). The hybrid method was validated against the UNSW-NB15 dataset that consists of features that describe regular (normal) and botnet traffic, where the latter refers to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The hybrid framework’s performance metrics were compared with several other classic machine learning models, as well as with other ELM solutions tuned by other population-based metaheuristics. Based on experimental data, the conclusion that the proposed method on average obtains the best performance can be derived. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) can classify each network’s flow behavior as benign or malicious by detecting heterogeneous features, including both categorical and numerical features. However, the present ML-based NIDSs are deemed insufficient in terms of their ability to generalize, particularly in changing network environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home. Although IoT devices add so much to home comforts, they also introduce potential risks and vulnerabilities. Recently, many NIDS studies on other IoT scenarios, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart cities, focus on utilizing the telemetry data of IoT devices for IoT intrusion detection. Because when IoT devices are under attack, their abnormal telemetry data values can reflect the anomaly state of those devices. Those telemetry data-based IoT NIDS methods detect intrusion events from a different view, focusing on the attack impact, from the traditional network traffic-based NIDS, which focuses on analyzing attack behavior. The telemetry data-based NIDS is more suitable for IoT devices without built-in security mechanisms. Considering the smart home IoT scenario, which has a smaller scope and a limited number of IoT devices compared to other IoT scenarios, both NIDS views can work independently. This motivated us to propose a novel ML-based NIDS to combine the network traffic-based and telemetry data-based NIDS together. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based IoT NIDS method to learn the behaviors and effects of attacks from different types of data that are generated in the heterogeneous IoT environment. The proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual embeddings for input network features. Based on the contextual embeddings, our method can solve the feature set challenge, including both continuous and categorical features. Our method is the first to utilize both network traffic data and IoT sensors’ telemetry data at the same time for intrusion detection. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our method on a realistic network traffic intrusion detection dataset named ToN_IoT, with an accuracy of 97.95% for binary classification and 95.78% for multiple classifications on pure network data. With the extra IoT information, the performance of our method has been improved to 98.39% and 97.06%, respectively. A comparative study with existing works shows that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ToN_IoT dataset. © 2023 by the authors.},

Several IoT devices may be impacted by a variety of IoT risks, including cyberattacks, inconsistent network connectivity, data leakage, etc. Machine learning (ML) techniques could be quite helpful in this case to guarantee security and authorization. Data anomalies must be discovered using statistics. This study investigates the dependability of IoT equipment that interacts. When determining a spam score, the six Machine Learning models are taken into account with increased input features including xgboost, BGLM, GLM, Bagging, and Stacking.

When compared to other recent approaches, the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The spamicity score of the home IoT device is calculated using the Spam Score algorithm. A publicly available dataset for smart homes meteorological data from the UCI repository and synthetic data from IoT devices are used to validate the technique. The results collected show just how effective the suggested algorithm is in analyzing time series data from the Internet of Things devices for spam identification. © 2024, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

Timely and accurate detection of attacks is critical to protect smart home networks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a cornerstone in any layered security defense strategy. However, building such a system is challenging given smart home devices' resource constraints and behaviors' diversity. This paper presents an adaptative IDS based on a device-specific approach and SDN deployment. We categorize devices based on traffic profiles to enable specialized architectural design and dynamically assign the suitable detection model. We demonstrate the IDS efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability by thoroughly benchmarking an ensemble of machine learning models, mainly tree ensemble models and extreme learning machine variants, on the up-to-date IoT CICIoT2023 security dataset. Our IDS multi-component device-aware architecture leverages software-defined networking and virtualized network functions for scalable deployment, with an edge computing design to meet strict latency requirements. The results reveal that our adaptive model selection ensures detection accuracy while maintaining low latency, aligning with the critical requirement of real-time accuracy and adaptability to smart home devices' traffic patterns. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

These devices are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks because of the inherent connectivity in Smart Home. The attacker can use many techniques to compromise the system or cause damage to it such as ransomware, data and identity theft, DDoS attacks, etc. The preliminary results of the study show that people do not have the necessary level of culture to deal with attacks, also they are not aware of the potential security risks in their Smart Homes. They are not aware of the need for more tools to secure them. In light of this issue, this study propose a novel intrusion detection system for Smart Home environments. The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on two deep learning algorithms CNN and LSTM. To train and test the proposed model this study use a new dataset called TON-IoT specific to IoT environment and contains many records about many recent attacks in this particular network. The main goal of this study is to help the user monitors his Smart Home devices by detecting intrusions using a Deep Learning approach. Then, the proposed system will show to the user the detected intrusions through a dashboard. Upon the detection of an intrusion in a device, a notification will be shown to the user through the dashboard. Besides, the system will recommend some countermeasures to the user to help him harden his Smart Home and reduce some potential risks. The obtained results shows that the study model outperforms many existing models based on Machine learning algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this modern age of technology, the Internet of Things has covered all aspects of life including smart situations, smart homes, and smart spaces. Smart homes have a large number of IoT objects that are working continuously without any interruption. Better security and authentication of these smart devices can provide peaceful environments to live in such spaces. It is important to monitor the activities of smart IoT devices to make them work fault-free. Such devices are small, consume relatively less power and resources, and are easily attackable by attackers. It is crucial to protect the integrity and characteristics of the smart home environment from external attacks. Machine Learning played a vital role in recognizing such malicious activities and attempts. Several Machine Learning approaches are available to detect the normal and abnormal behavior of IoT device traffic. This study proposed a machine learning-based anomaly detection approach for smart homes using different classifiers. Testing and evaluation are performed using the University of New South Wales (UNSW) BoT IoT dataset. Machine learning models based on four classifiers are built using an IoT devices dataset. For the Test dataset, the Weighted Precision, Recall, and F1 score of Random forest, decision tree, and AdaBoost is 1 as compared to ANN which has 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96 respectively Results show that high performance, precision, and robustness can be achieved using the proposed methodology. In this way, smart homes' security and identity of devices can be monitored and anomalies can be detected with high accuracy. Attack categories include binary class, multiclass class, and subclasses. Results show Random Forest algorithm outperforms enough to use this methodology in smart environments.  © 2023 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) on a global scale has facilitated the convergence of revolutionary technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing. The integration of these technologies has paved the way for the development of intricate infrastructures, such as smart homes, smart cities, and smart industries, that are capable of delivering advanced solutions and enhancing human living standards. Nevertheless, IoT devices, while providing effective connectivity and convenience, often rely on traditional network interfaces that can be vulnerable to exploitation by adversaries. If not properly secured and updated, these legacy communication protocols and interfaces can expose potential vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or compromise sensitive data. To overcome the security challenges associated with smart home systems, we have devised a robust framework that leverages the capabilities of both AI and blockchain technology. The proposed framework employs a standard dataset for smart home systems, from which we first eliminated the anomalies using an isolation forest (IF) algorithm using random partitioning, path length, anomaly score calculation, and thresholding stages. Next, the dataset is utilized for training classification algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to classify the attack and non-attack data of the smart home system. Further, an interplanetary file system (IPFS) is utilized to store classified data (non-attack data) from classification algorithms to confront data-manipulation attacks. The IPFS acts as an onsite storage system, securely storing non-attack data, and its computed hash is forwarded to the blockchain’s immutable ledger. We evaluated the proposed framework with different performance parameters. These include training accuracy (99.53%) by the KNN classification algorithm and 99.27% by IF for anomaly detection. Further, we used the validation curve, lift curve, execution cost of blockchain transactions, and scalability (86.23%) to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) allow flexible and efficient automated detection of cyberattacks in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, this has also created an additional attack vector; the machine learning models which support the IDS's decisions may also be subject to cyberattacks known as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In the context of IoT, AML can be used to manipulate data and network traffic that traverse through such devices. These perturbations increase the confusion in the decision boundaries of the machine learning classifier, where malicious network packets are often miss-classified as being benign. Consequently, such errors are bypassed by machine learning based detectors, which increases the potential of significantly delaying attack detection and further consequences such as personal information leakage, damaged hardware, and financial loss. Given the impact that these attacks may have, this paper proposes a rule-based approach towards generating AML attack samples and explores how they can be used to target a range of supervised machine learning classifiers used for detecting Denial of Service attacks in an IoT smart home network. The analysis explores which DoS packet features to perturb and how such adversarial samples can support increasing the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. The results demonstrated that the performance of all the top performing classifiers were affected, decreasing a maximum of 47.2 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks. © 2021},

   abstract = {With the advances in technology, IoT devices have become an integral part of our daily lives due to their rapid expansion and deployment. As the IoT devices communicate continuously leads to concerns about privacy and security due to vulnerabilities which the attackers can exploit. The raw observations of sensor nodes influence the decision-making in IoT networks. So, it requires an established method to monitor and analyze the data from the sensor nodes. Therefore, data collected nodes in IoT systems must resist attacks through anomaly detection implemented on the data collected sensor nodes. This paper proposed the CatBoosting approach to perform intelligent and adaptive anomaly detection for smart home environment devices. The proposed approach assists in supervising the data with normal and abnormal activities with enhanced resources management. The DS2OS dataset with several attacks on the IoT environment is considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly-based detection system. Moreover, various researchers existing approaches on the DS2OS dataset is studied and described briefly with the proposed method. Finally, the experimentation of the simulation model performance and evaluation is evaluated through different metrics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

   abstract = {Modern smart home control systems utilize realtime occupancy and activity monitoring to ensure control efficiency, occupants' comfort, and optimal energy consumption. Moreover, adopting machine learning-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) enhances security and reliability. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although ADMs limit attack scopes, the availability of information like occupants' location, conducted activities, and alteration capability of smart appliances increase the attack surface. Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems is crucial to design robust defense solutions. However, state-of-the-art analyzers do not consider contemporary control and defense solutions and generate trivial attack vectors. To address this, we propose a control and defense-aware novel attack analysis framework for a modern smart home control system, efficiently extracting ADM rules. We verify and validate our framework using a state-of-the-art dataset and a prototype testbed. © 2023 IEEE.},

The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results. The presented model can be used for the real-time security of smart home cyber-physical systems and develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Traditional machine learning (ML) methods for anomaly detection often require sharing sensitive IoT data with a central server, posing security and efficiency challenges. In response, this paper introduces FedGroup, a novel Federated Learning (FL) method inspired by FedAvg. FedGroup revolutionizes the central model’s learning process by updating it based on the learning patterns of distinct groups of IoT devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedGroup consistently achieves comparable or superior accuracy in anomaly detection when compared to both federated and non-federated learning methods. Additionally, Ensemble Learning (EL) collects intelligence from numerous contributing models, leading to enhanced prediction performance. Furthermore, FedGroup significantly improves the detection of attack types and their details, contributing to a more robust security framework for smart homes.

However, it also provides a sequence of novel cyber-security issues. Although IoT networks provide several advantages, the heterogeneous nature of the network and the wide connectivity of the devices make the network easy for cyber-attackers. Cyberattacks result in financial loss and data breaches for organizations and individuals. So, it becomes crucial to secure the IoT environment from such cyberattacks. With this motivation, the current study introduces an effectual Enhanced Crow Search Algorithm with Deep Learning-Driven Cyberattack Detection (ECSADL-CAD) model for the Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT environment. The presented ECSADL-CAD approach aims to identify and classify the cyberattacks in the SDN-enabled IoT envi-ronment. To attain this, the ECSADL-CAD model initially pre-processes the data. In the presented ECSADL-CAD model, the Reinforced Deep Belief Network (RDBN) model is employed for attack detection. At last, the ECSA-based hyperparameter tuning process gets executed to boost the overall classification outcomes. A series of simulations were conducted to validate the improved outcomes of the proposed ECSADL-CAD model. The experimental outcomes confirmed the superiority of the proposed ECSADL-CAD model over other existing methodologies. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

The IoT is steadily becoming a staple of everyday life, having been implemented into various diverse applications, such as cities, smart homes, and transportation. However, despite the technological advancements that the IoT brings, various new security risks have also been introduced due to the development of new types of attacks. This prevents current intelligent IoT applications from adaptively learning from other intelligent IoT applications, which leaves them in a volatile state. In this paper, we conducted a structured literature review (SLR) on Smart Home's IoT attack detection using machine learning and deep learning. Four journal databases were used to perform this review: IEEE, Science Direct, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and SpringerLink. Sixty articles were selected and studied, where we noted the various patterns and techniques present in the framework of the selected research. We also took note of the different machine learning and deep learning methods, the types of attacks, and the Network layers present in Smart Home. By conducting an SLR, we analyzed the numerous techniques of IoT attack detection for smart homes proposed by various theoretical studies. We enhanced the studied literature by proposing a new solution for better IoT attack detection in smart homes. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The advent of smart homes has revolutionized residential living, integrating advanced technologies and intelligent devices to create secure, comfortable, and efficient environments. However, this integration of diverse smart devices has brought significant cybersecurity challenges. Detecting and analyzing abnormal network packets have become paramount, signifying potential intrusions, malicious activities, or system errors and ensuring the security and stability of smart home systems. Machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forests, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, most research has concentrated on anomaly detection rather than malicious activity in smart homes. The vast datasets collected from various scenarios pose methodological and algorithmic challenges for applying machine learning techniques. To fill these research gaps, our study introduces traditional machine-learning methods for detecting abnormal network packets in smart homes using the IoT-23 dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models. The correlation matrix helps validate the feature selection of the best models based on performance metrics like precision, F1-score, recall, accuracy ratio, training score, and training time cost. Additionally, the study classifies 12 types of malicious malware across different machine learning models, considering performance within the context of smart home devices. This study implements real-time anomaly detection on the Raspberry Pi using packet captures and Zeek flowmeter methods. The findings contribute insights into models suitable for smart home security. In addition, our research enhances the understanding and application of machine learning methods for bolstering security in smart homes.  © 2023 ACM.},

   abstract = {Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) is an extension of Digital Twin with cognitive capabilities to monitor and analyse complex and unforeseen behaviours and to ensure critical reasoning and decision-making. Thus, CDT has a potential for enhancing cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications such as smart homes. In this paper, we developed a conceptual CDT architecture for improving cybersecurity in smart homes with dynamic threat detection and mitigation capabilities. The proposed approach applies closed feedback loops between cognitive process and cybersecurity using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This will allow continuous monitoring of security-related information and analytics with complex behaviours within a virtual environment. The developed approach allows security testing and simulation in the virtual world for prediction and anticipation of dynamic security threats. It also facilitates dynamic updates to the physical world of attack prevention strategies for the dynamic optimization of smart homes security. Finally, this paper discusses the applicability of the developed CDT architecture in other IoT-based critical sectors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) have various applications in different sectors of life, such as healthcare, agriculture, industries, transportation, smart cities, smart homes, etc., and their number is increasing with each passing day. The rapid development of IoT and its increasing demand in different fields of life create a serious problem of security for the IoT environment, which needs serious consideration to protect the IoT-enabled systems from external networks and cyber-attacks. Because of the open deployment environment and constrained resources, the IoT is prone to malicious assaults. Furthermore, the IoT’s diverse and dispersed properties make it difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to keep up with current technological developments. An ML-enabled IoT-based IDS is one of the most important security methods that can assist in defending computer networks and the IoT environment from numerous attacks and malicious activities. Keeping in mind the significant contribution of ML to securing the IoT environment, we proposed an ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT networks and applications in this study. In the proposed system, we proposed a modified Random Forest (RF) algorithm and compared its performance with nine well-known ML algorithms for the detection of network attacks. Further, two of the most recent and well-known network datasets, i.e., TON-IoT and UNSW-NB15, are used to check the effectiveness of the ML-enabled IDS. The performance of the utilized ML algorithms was measured with the help of different performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, etc. The experimental outcomes illustrate the importance of the proposed ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT environment and applications. The proposed system applies to almost all of the resource-constrained devices that use the IoT network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are common in today’s computer networks. These devices can be computationally powerful, yet prone to cybersecurity exploitation. To remedy these growing security weaknesses, this work proposes a new artificial intelligence method that makes these IoT networks safer through the use of autonomous, swarm-based cybersecurity penetration testing. In this work, the introduced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) penetration testing technique is compared against traditional linear and queue-based approaches to find vulnerabilities in smart homes and IoT networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PSO approach, a network simulator is used to simulate smart home networks of two scales: a small, home network and a large, commercial-sized network. These experiments demonstrate that the swarm-based algorithms detect vulnerabilities significantly faster than the linear algorithms. The presented findings support the case that autonomous and swarm-based penetration testing in a network could be used to render more secure IoT networks in the future. This approach can affect private households with smart home networks, settings within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and military environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

A growing number of homes are becoming "smarter" by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve comfort, energy efficiency, and safety. Increases in resource-constrained IoT devices heighten security threats and vulnerabilities connected with them. Using SDN and virtualization, the IoT's size and adaptability can be managed at a lower cost than ever before. Using these intelligent security solutions, we can achieve real-time detection and automation for attack detection and prevention using artificial intelligence. Consequently, a large variety of solutions utilizing machine learning and deep learning have been developed to mitigate attacks on the IoT. Thus, the goal of this work is to use machine learning and deep learning to defend smart homes with SDN-based. We have designed smart home environments using Software-Defined Networking and Mininet that provide Instant Virtual networks for IoT in smart homes. Two datasets were used in this work: the first SDN dataset, which we acquired from smart homes by launching real attacks and creating normal traffic, and the second IoTID20 dataset, which is publicly available online. On both datasets, conducted ML and DL experiments. The best accuracy on SDN Dataset was 99.9% using Xgboost classifier, and on IoTID20 was 98.9% LSTM in binary classification, and ANN 85.7% on multiclass. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

   abstract = {Cybersecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT) is the practice of implementing measures to secure networks and connected devices from data breaches, cyber threats, and unauthorized access. It is essential owing to the increasing interconnectivity of devices, ranging from smart home appliances to industrial sensors. The potential attack surface expands, necessitating strong cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data, ensure privacy, and prevent disruptions to critical services with these increasing number of IoT devices. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches, hold the potential to mitigate and identify cyberattacks on IoT networks. DL demonstrates promise for effectively preventing and detecting security threats within IoT devices. Despite the importance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in maintaining confidentiality by detecting suspicious activities, classical IDS solutions might face difficulties in the IoT platform. Therefore, this study presents an Artificial Orca Algorithm with Ensemble Learning cyberattack detection and classification (AOAEL-CDC) methodology in an environment of IoT. The presented AOAEL-CDC technique exploited the feature selection (FS) approach with an ensemble learning approach for cyberattack recognition and identification in the IoT atmosphere. In the developed AOAEL-CDC model, the feature selection takes place using the AOA technique. For the cyberattack detection process, the ensemble learning process is carried out by the use of three models such as bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Finally, the hyperparameter range of the DL techniques takes place using the marine predator&#x2019;s algorithm (MPA). To examine the performance analysis of the AOAEL-CDC methodology, a series of simulations take place using a benchmark dataset. An extensive comparative study reported that the BCODL-SDSC technique reaches an effective performance with other models with a maximum accuracy of 99.31%. Authors},

The social setting is very important for this. Communication networks provide uninterrupted internet connectivity for both fixed and mobile devices like PCs and smartphones. Customers may now keep up their level of engagement while interacting with one or more apps at any time and from any location, thanks to developments in information and communication technologies. Many kinds of smart devices might potentially coordinate their responses to events, sending out alerts or keeping records of the system's condition in line with a predetermined policy. Constant progress toward intelligent solutions is improving many facets of modern life, including manufacturing, transportation, electronic healthcare, electronic education, and many more. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the IoT is autonomous and dynamic. Diverse approaches are being developed to address the challenges posed by disparate data sources, fluctuating signal quality, and overwhelming quantities of data. From the perspectives of intelligent system technologies, security, vulnerabilities, and the potential role that intelligent solutions based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) may play, this article examines the IoT. Concerns about privacy and safety have arisen as a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose that the Standard Security Framework (SSF) be made mandatory for all distributed networks to ensure that hardware and software modules may communicate with one another regardless of their respective platforms. In addition, the effectiveness and security of new innovations in using fog and edge computing in conjunction with cloud applications have been studied. . © 2023 IEEE.},

The novelty of this work is, a recently developed DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features. Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation parameters. © 2024, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are nowadays massively integrated in daily life: homes, factories, or public places. This technology offers attractive services to improve the quality of life as well as new economic markets through the exploitation of the collected data. However, these connected objects have also become attractive targets for attackers because their current security design is often weak or flawed, as illustrated by several vulnerabilities such as Mirai, Blueborne, etc. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting intrusions in smart spaces such as smarthomes, or smartfactories, that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer using machine learning techniques. The approach is designed to be independent of the large and heterogeneous set of wireless communication protocols typically implemented by connected objects such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) or proprietary communication protocols. The main concepts of the proposed approach are presented together with an experimental case study illustrating its feasibility based on data collected during the deployment of the intrusion detection approach in a smart home under real-life conditions. © 2018 IEEE.},

The security of IoT -based systems requires a critical engineering infrastructure when dealing with home security. Any proposed home security framework should establish an automatic access monitoring and regular updates of the system software and firmware according to the ongoing threats. In this paper, we provide an insightful short review of security issues in smart home systems. We highlight several popular IoT protocols and provide critical analysis of their performance against various security threats. Mitigation strategies are also presented to reduce the impact of cyberattacks on smart home systems. Furthermore, our analysis shows that DDoS is one of the most common threats to smart home systems. Therefore, we developed an ML-based model to detect DDoS attacks. We employed unique characteristics of IoT traffic to engineer features that enable ML algorithms to accurately classify DDoS traffic from normal/benign traffic. © 2020 IEEE.},

Security challenges will become an increasingly significant issue, especially in smart homes that depend entirely on IoT devices. Due to the weak infrastructure of the IoT, it is vulnerable to various types of cyber-attacks. The most common IoT attacks are distributed denial of service (DDoS). Most traditional security solutions, like intrusion detection systems (IDS), cannot detect most attacks. Complexity is being hidden by a new paradigm that recently arose, called the software-defined system that is brings a significant change to the networking industry, a great solution for mitigation of attacks that can adopt deep learning technique to encounter cyber-attacks based on the attack behavior and by filtering normal and attack traffic by using well-defined rules. This paper proposed a system by suggesting middleware that can help mitigate or prevent various attacks on IoT on smart home environment. Machine learning has included in the middleware to provide automatic protection against cyber-attacks on IoT networks. A promising approach to protecting real-time, highly accurate attacks on SDN-managed IoT networks has been proposed. This middleware allows IoT devices to efficiently handle evolving security threats dynamically and adaptively without impacting the IoT devices.  © 2021 IEEE.},

It also helps saving costs from purchasing expensive intrusion prevention software and hardware to install at home. For the prevention method, we provide both the signature-based method using Snort software and the behavior-based method which learns and analyzes IoT devices' behavior by using either the baseline or the machine learning in order to increase the system performance.

IoT has grown rapidly over the past decade with more than 25 billion devices expected to be connected by 2020. The volume of data released from these devices will increase many-fold in the years to come. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT devices produces a large amount of data with a number of different modalities having varying data quality defined by its speed in terms of time and position dependency. In such an environment, machine learning (ML) algorithms can play an important role in ensuring security and authorization based on biotechnology, anomalous detection to improve the usability, and security of IoT systems. On the other hand, attackers often view learning algorithms to exploit the vulnerabilities in smart IoT-based systems. Motivated from these, in this article, we propose the security of the IoT devices by detecting spam using ML. To achieve this objective, Spam Detection in IoT using Machine Learning framework is proposed. In this framework, five ML models are evaluated using various metrics with a large collection of inputs features sets. Each model computes a spam score by considering the refined input features. This score depicts the trustworthiness of IoT device under various parameters. REFIT Smart Home data set is used for the validation of proposed technique. The results obtained proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other existing schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Individual IoT devices have some form of intrusion detection system integrated, but once they are all connected, a network threat to one device could mean a threat to many. IoT devices must have a robust intrusion detection system that would keep devices secure over a network. To aid with this, we provide a machine learning solution that adheres to Global Data Protection Regulation by keeping the user data secure locally on the IoT device itself. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) approach that capitalizes on a decentralized and collaborative way of training machine learning models. In this study, we practice federated learning technique to train and create a robust intrusion detection model for the security of IoT devices.

We implement a malicious browser extension to the Chrome web browser that can alter the user input in a smart home management console. We empirically demonstrate that these browser extensions can manipulate IoT devices in a smart home. We discuss countermeasures for securing the remote control systems of smart homes against man-in-the-browser attacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {The significant increase of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes and other smart infrastructure, and the recent attacks on these IoT devices, are motivating factors to secure and protect IoT networks. The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Integration of the Internet into the entities of the different domains of human society (such as smart homes, health care, smart grids, manufacturing processes, product supply chains, and environmental monitoring) is emerging as a new paradigm called the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ubiquitous and wide-range IoT networks make them prone to cyberattacks. One of the main types of attack is a denial of service (DoS), where the attacker floods the network with a large volume of data to prevent nodes from using the services. An intrusion detection mechanism is considered a chief source of protection for information and communications technology. However, conventional intrusion detection methods need to be modified and improved for application to the IoT owing to certain limitations, such as resource-constrained devices, the limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and specific protocol stacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing a supervised machine learning-based support vector machine (SVM) to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier, aided by a combination of two or three incomplex features, can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time. © 2013 IEEE.},

First, according to some internal operation mechanisms of ZigBee protocol, we analyze the potential attack threats on ZigBee during its operation, and propose four specific attacks including association attack, replay attack, network PANID conflict attack and malicious orphan frame attack. Then we propose corresponding detection schemes for those four attacks. Besides, we point out two possible vulnerabilities in ZigBee Network: network short address conflict vulnerability and association table vulnerability. Finally, we design a ZigBee attack detection system which is divided into three parts: device scanning module, attack detection module and vulnerability detection module. The system has the characteristics of rapid deployment and rapid detection. It can meet some simple security requirements of a ZigBee application scene.},

Thus, this paper proposes a Machine Learning-driven methodology for multiclass classification of cyber-attacks in IoT networks and investigates the robustness of the Machine and Deep Learning classifiers against several well-known Adversarial Machine Learning attacks (JSMA, FGSM, DeepFool). Moreover, the effectiveness of the Adversarial Training defense method has been studied in tackling Adversarial Machine Learning attacks. The proposed methodology was evaluated using a new and large IoT dataset (IoTID20) and the experimental results concluded that the Random Forest classifier can classify the cyber-attacks with high classification accuracy (99.9%) as well as the JSMA, FGSM, and DeepFool attacks can significantly reduce the performance of all the classifiers. Finally, based on the evaluation adversarial training can overall enhance the classifiers’ robustness against all the utilized Adversarial Machine Learning attacks without affecting the performance when only normal samples are present.},

This study integrates a hybrid autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to use AI to solve security problems. The UNSW-NB15 dataset, a benchmark for network IDSs, is used to rigorously evaluate the proposed model.&nbsp;An autoencoder and GAN combination offers promising IDS for IoT networks. The autoencoder component excels at capturing concise and illustrative data representations, enabling it to spot network anomalies. The GAN component improves the model's ability to generate synthetic data samples that closely resemble network traffic patterns, making it easier to identify complex and novel attacks.&nbsp;The UNSW-NB15 dataset is known for its extensive network traffic data, making it ideal for testing the proposed artificial intelligence-based IDS. The proposed hybrid model achieves 99.13% accuracy. The result outperforms traditional DL methods. The proposed model's increased precision shows its ability to detect and address network anomaly risks.&nbsp; The proposed system is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, MCC, and Cohen's Kappa. The thorough evaluation shows that the Proposed hybrid autoencoder-GAN model provides a complete and efficient IoT network security solution in all dimensions.&nbsp;In conclusion, artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection and a hybrid model that combines autoencoder and generative adversarial network techniques improve IoT network security. The model's UNSW-NB15 dataset accuracy shows its ability to protect IoT ecosystems from many threats.

IoT devices are often connected to networks and to the internet, making them potential targets for cyberattacks (e.g., Mirai attack). As the IoT ecosystem grows, there’s a pressing need to enhance cybersecurity measures to ensure the protection of these interconnected devices and the data they handle. On the other hand, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves the collection, analysis, and distribution of information about potential and ongoing cyber threats. CTI helps organizations understand the threat landscape and take proactive measures to mitigate risks. In the context of IoT, having timely and accurate CTI is crucial for identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities. While sharing CTI knowledge is important, doing so in a distributed IoT environment presents challenges. The data generated and collected by IoT devices can be sensitive and private, making it essential to find ways to share CTI knowledge without compromising data privacy. This research focuses on leveraging Federated Learning (FL) techniques to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving CTI knowledge sharing in IoT networks by proposing a solution called FedCTI.

The home network is at a vantage point for deploying security appliances to deal with such IoT attacks. We propose a comprehensive home network defense, Pot2DPI, and use it to raise an attacker's uncertainty about devices and enable the home network to monitor traffic, detect anomalies, and filter malicious packets. The security offered by Pot2DPI comes from a synthesis of practical techniques: honeypot, deep packet inspection (DPI), and a realization of moving target defense (MTD) in port forwarding. In particular, Pot2DPI has a chain of honeypot and DPI that collects suspicious packet traces, acquires attack signatures, and installs filtering rules at a home router timely. Meanwhile, Pot2DPI shuffles the mapping of ports between the router and the devices connected to it, making a targeted attack difficult and defense more effective. Pot2DPI is our first step towards securing a smart home.},

   abstract = {Rule learning based intrusion detection systems (IDS) regularly collect and process network traffic, and thereafter they apply rule learning algorithms to the data to identify network communication behaviors represented as IF-THEN rules. Detection rules are inferred offline and can be periodically automatically updated online for intrusion detection. In this context, we implement in the present paper various attacks against MQTT in a carefully designed and very realistic experiment environment, instead of a simulation program as commonly seen in previous works, for data generation. Besides, we investigate a Bayesian rule learning based approach as countermeasure, which is able to detect various attack types. A Bayesian network is learned from training data and subsequently translated into a rule set for intrusion detection. The combination of prior knowledge (about the communication protocol and target system) and data help to efficiently learn the Bayesian network. The translation from the Bayesian network to a set of inherently interpretable rules can be regarded as a transformation from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge. We show that our proposed method can achieve not only good detection performance but also high interpretability.},

Smartphones allow homeowners to remotely operate these devices and monitor and manage their homes in real time. Smart home devices use IoT to make life smarter, more effective, and more customized. Smart home IoT devices may be hacked to access security cameras and personal data. Attackers might manipulate smart locks or thermostats, threatening people and their property. These IoT devices are networked, making strong cybersecurity necessary to guard against emerging threats. Early cybersecurity identification enables quick reaction and remediation, limiting damage and averting attack escalation. Early detection of security breaches allows proactive actions to stop unwanted access, limit the effect, and protect critical data. It dramatically minimizes the window of vulnerability, improving cybersecurity resilience and safeguarding systems from protracted exploitation or criminal activity. This research improves smart home security by training Aposemat IoT-23 dataset. XGBoost, Simple Neural Network, GaussianNB and Logistic Regression are evaluated to identify and prevent harmful data injection and illegal access. The results show they protect smart home networks with over 99% accuracy. Smart home IoT device protection is excellent with machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Simple Neural Network.

This research proposes a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system using network traffic data from five smart home IoT devices under attack. The “Gafgyt” and “Mirai” botnet attacks against IoT devices were categorized into five. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) ML algorithms were used to identify attack from benign traffic data in over a million records from individual devices utilizing 115 factors. The best feature analysis was done utilizing the RF method to improve model correctness and processing speed. With 99.99% accuracy, 99.87% precision, 99.79% recall, and 99.89% AUROC rating, RF is superior.

   abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of smart home devices, securing these networks from cyber threats is a vital concern. A common cyber intrusion in smart home networks is the compromise of IoT devices by malware to form botnets; furthermore, most proposed solutions lack domain adaptation, struggling to generalize to related distributions. Although deep learning has shown remarkable success in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition as adaptive solutions. Nevertheless, it has its limitations in other domains, such as network security, because deep learning has the ability to work mainly with homogeneous unstructured datasets, in contrast to heterogeneous structured datasets. Despite efforts to address this with deep learning models for structured data (tabular data), gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) like XGBoost still outperform in this domain. However, recent empirical research indicated the significant impact of incorporating domain knowledge for training models that yield high F-1 scores on independent datasets compared to other models without incorporating domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to develop an adaptive flow-based NIDS for smart home networks based on XGBoost combined with Rough Set Theory. The proposed approach is evaluated using the AUC-ROC Curve, Accuracy, and F1 score metrics, including assessment on independent data points. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our adaptive flow-based NIDS by combining XGBoost with acquired knowledge from Rough Set Theory.},

The development of trusted ML systems can be achieved with the help of technical tools such as probabilistic modeling, Markov decision process. temporal decision process. Then, to achieve a reliable machine-learning framework, a simple way could be to utilize an ensemble for the regular models. This can develop reliable predictions.

But, public access to accumulated heterogeneous IoT urban information is prone to hackers attacking connected devices to the internet intellectual property as well. IoT security serves a dynamic part in the smart city. Some IoT devices are connected in smart homes, and these connections were centred on gateways. In smart homes, the gateways gain a lot of significance; but their centralized structure causes many security vulnerabilities like availability, integrity, and certification. Unified “cloud-like” computing networks and Blockchain (BC) type systems should be used to sort out these problems. Therefore, this article develops a Blockchain-Assisted Secure Smart Home Network using Gradient Based Optimizer with Hybrid Deep Learning (BSSHN-GBOHDL) model. The presented BSSHN-GBOHDL technique employs BC technology to improve the confidentiality of the data in the smart home environment. In addition, the BSSHN-GBOHDL technique identifies malicious activities in the smart home environment via three sub-processes namely data preprocessing, hybrid deep learning (HDL)-based malicious activity classification, and GBO-based hyperparameter tuning. The GBO algorithm assists in the proficient hyperparameter selection of the HDL model, which aids in accomplishing increased detection efficiency. The experimental validation of the BSSHN-GBOHDL approach is tested on a benchmark NSL-KDD dataset with 65495 normal and 60743 attack samples. The results highlight the betterment of the BSSHN-GBOHDL approach over other recent methods with maximum accuracy of 98.29%.},

Such devices are now part of our everyday’s life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers.

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an enabler paradigm for different applications, such as healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and recently, enterprise systems. Significant advances in IoT networks have been hindered by security vulnerabilities and threats, which, if not addressed, can negatively impact the deployment and operation of IoT-enabled systems. This article addresses IoT security and presents an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 μs. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 μs. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature. Thus, it is an accurate and lightweight tool for detecting intrusions in IoT systems.},

Security in IoT has begun to be widely studied along with the outbreak of IoT devices used from smart homes to smart industries. IoT devices have limitations on their hardware performance. These devices are elementary to be disturbed by attackers through the internet network. Therefore, finding the attack's source as early as possible is imperative. An attack source that can be detected quickly will avoid a fatal impact on the survival of IoT devices. Availability is what is expected in IoT data connectivity. This paper proposes using an intelligent system based on particle swarm optimization algorithms to detect attacks as early as possible. From the results obtained, this algorithm can detect the source of the attack even though it takes up more bandwidth than traditional schemes. This method can support the functionality of the intrusion prevention system in the next-generation firewall. This attack detection system is a must on all modern IoT devices.},

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a basic and essential security mechanism to detect malicious traffic. In the literature, in addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, many deep learning schemes have been examined to enhance the detection performance. However, insufficient amounts of labeled samples are still a challenge for real-world implementation, especially in some scenarios such as smart home and Internet of Vehicles. To address this issue, we explore transfer learning as a promising solution. In this work, we develop TDL-IDS, a transfer deep learning based IDS that can work with limited labeled data items. Our approach first uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model on the source domain and then leverages transfer learning to continue the training process on the target domain. In the evaluation, we use NSL-KDD as the source domain, and AWID as the target domain. Our results indicate that TDL-IDS can outperform many similar approaches.},

However, IoT devices are vulnerable due to their inadequate security defense mechanisms and increasing security vulnerabilities during rapid proliferation. A bi-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) based on device behavior profiling is proposed in this paper for smart home IoT networks. The system is composed of a supervised learning model and a novel rule set module, which enable the IDS to conduct detection duties more rapidly and accurately. The proposed IDS accomplishes three main functions: 1) detect malicious network traffic targeted at IoT devices, 2) reveal the attack types represented by malicious traffic, and 3) automatically construct the rule set reflecting benign device behaviors to expedite detection. A testbed is established to capture network traffic from real smart home IoT devices in order to conduct device profile investigations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed IDS, a unique test dataset is constructed. False Alarm Rate (FAR) and Missing Alarm Rate (MAR) values are calculated for evaluation. The system performance is evaluated in terms of detection and classification accuracy. The accuracy of detection is shown by FAR and MAR, both of which can reach 0%. The accuracy of classification is given by the F1 score, which can reach 99.51%.},

However, smart homes are vulnerable to many cyberattacks, and the most striking one is energy theft.

Nevertheless, recent advances are not robust enough in practice, partially due to the vulnerabilities of employed ML algorithms. Given a group of smart homes, in this article, we present a covert electricity theft strategy through mimicking normal consumption patterns and compromising neighboring meters concurrently. Such attack is almost impossible to be detected by existing solutions as the manipulated data have little deviation against honest usage records. To address this threat, we initially identify and define two levels of consumption deviations: home-level and interpersonal-level, respectively. Then, we design a feature extraction scheme that can capture the correlation between attacks and honest customers. Finally, we develop a new deep learning-based detection model. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that the presented attack could evade existing mainstream detectors but still gain high profits. In addition, the proposed countermeasure outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods.},

These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology has made smart homes more prevalent in everyday lives. However, anomalies in IoT data may be emblematic of potential cybersecurity risks like false data injection attacks or physical security risks like house fires. In this paper, we propose a segmentation based anomaly detection method that converts unsupervised time-series data into a supervised format, and then trains a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to detect anomalies. The LSTM network is trained to predict un-sound statistical properties, which gets combined with sound statistical properties, to detect anomalies in IoT sensor data. Data smoothing using Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing is also performed, without loss of information, to improve anomaly detector performance. Using Precision, Recall, and F-Measure scores as metrics, results show efficient anomaly detection performance on IoT temperature sensor data. We, additionally, test performance by varying specific parameters. Lastly, results also show that performing data smoothing, to a certain extent, can improve anomaly detection performance over data that didn’t undergo any smoothing.},

Deep learning and big data analytics have great potential in designing and developing robust security mechanisms for IIoT networks. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep random neural network (HDRaNN) for cyberattack detection in the IIoT is presented. The HDRaNN combines a deep random neural network and a multilayer perceptron with dropout regularization.

The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through a number of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, Region of Convergence (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The HDRaNN classified 16 different types of cyberattacks using with higher accuracy of 98% and 99% for DS2OS and UNSW-NB15, respectively. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the performance metrics are also compared with several state-of-the-art attack detection algorithms.

A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.},

These security and privacy defending techniques have enabled sophisticated approaches to ensure security and preserve user privacy. However, due to the fact that different approaches are evaluated using their own datasets, their own developed security and privacy attack models, and their own evaluating metrics, it is being significantly difficult to make a fair and comprehensive comparisons among different IoT security strengthening and user privacy preserving research to better understand IoT security issues and end-user benefits. To address this problem, we present a deep learning-based adversarial attack model framework-SmartAttack, which enables a set of sophisticated adversarial attack models that can be leveraged by researchers and industrial users from IoT security community to better evaluate their work. In essence, we leverage the most widely used unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models to design and implement these attack models. SmartAttack also provides user options to select the detailed configuration for each attack model, such as kernel, dataset splitting, cross-validation states, and evaluating metrics. We also evaluate the performance of SmartAttack using two different datasets.

To address this, a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of these devices needs to be devised. Towards this goal, a smart home scenario is simulated using Smart Cameras and brute-force, and DDoS attacks were launched to capture variations in power profile.

The simple solution of deploying a supervised machine learning algorithm at a centralized location in the network neither scales well nor can identify new devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose and develop a distributed device fingerprinting technique (DEFT), a distributed fingerprinting solution that addresses and exploits the presence of common devices, including new devices, across smart homes and enterprises in a network. A DEFT controller develops and maintains classifiers for fingerprinting, while gateways located closer to the IoT devices at homes perform device classification. Importantly, the controller and gateways coordinate to identify new devices in the network. DEFT is designed to be scalable and dynamic-it can be deployed, orchestrated, and controlled using software-defined networking and network function virtualization. DEFT is able to identify new device types automatically, while achieving high accuracy and low false positive rate.

Therefore, to improve the detection accuracy, most ML-based intrusion detection solutions focus only on investigating appropriate ML algorithms. Yet, the limitations in terms of detection accuracy in various attacks are often caused by lack of appropriate detection features.

Major IoT application domains are identified, vulnerabilities are analyzed, and techniques for reducing security risks are suggested in this research. This study uses a mixed-method approach, beginning with a thorough assessment of the literature to identify the most well-known applications for IoT across sectors like industrial, smart cities, healthcare, and smart homes. Current weaknesses related to IoT networks and devices are also examined. Researchers and manufacturers will be able to assess and restrict the vulnerability range on IoT devices with the aid of this study.},

   abstract = {Recently, Smart Home Systems (SHSs) have gained enormous popularity with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Besides offering many tangible benefits, SHSs are vulnerable to attacks that lead to security and privacy concerns for SHS users. Machine learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed to address such concerns. Conventionally, ML models are trained and tested on computationally powerful platforms such as cloud services. Nevertheless, the data shared with the cloud is vulnerable to privacy attacks and causes latency, which decreases the performance of real-time applications like intrusion detection systems. Therefore, on-device ML models, in which the user data is kept locally, have emerged as promising solutions to ensure the security and privacy of the data for real-time applications. However, performing ML tasks requires high energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to analyze the energy consumption of ML-based IDS. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of on-device ML algorithms in terms of energy consumption for IoT intrusion detection applications. For a thorough analysis, we study the training and inference phases separately. For training, we compare the cloud computing-based ML, edge computing-based ML, and IoT device-based ML approaches. For the inference, we evaluate the TinyML approach to run the ML algorithms on tiny IoT devices such as Micro Controller Units (MCUs). Comparative performance evaluations show that deploying the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm on-device gives better results in terms of training time, inference time, and power consumption.},

   abstract = {From smart homes to smart cities and Industry 4.0 to Transportation Systems, Internet of Things (IoT) is a domain which promises incredible growth coupled with great impact, in numerous fields. IoT networks are composed of numerous different Things, arranged in diverse topologies with diverse needs. This diversity is partially due to the numerous areas where IoT applications are utilized, which at their entirety can be referred as the IoT ecosystem. The IoT ecosystem suffers from numerous vulnerabilities, due to reasons such as design flows, hardware limitation or simply human error and is subject to various attacks targeting IoT services, platforms and networks. These attacks can have significant consequences such as economic losses, service disruption or data leaks. Cyber-attacks are an unavoidable and must be faced in tandem with the global growth of IoT networks. An approach that can assist in developing robust, intelligent Cyber-security tools for IoT is using Artificial Intelligence. In the following paper, a mechanism is presented that automatically selects appropriate mitigation actions in an optimal way to countermeasure attacks faced by IoT networks. This is achieved by using an novel Artificial Intelligence mechanism based on a Deep Neural Architecture called Pointer Networks to optimize security-related KPIs. Experimental results, show that the proposed method produces equal or better Pareto optimal solutions, performs faster compared to state-of-the-art (SoA) algorithms and scales better.},

   abstract = {Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories , or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method.},

   abstract = {This work introduces a decision support framework, called Cyber Risk Optimiser for Smart homeS (CROSS), which advises both smart home users and smart home service providers on how to select an optimal portfolio of cyber security controls to counteract cyber attacks in a smart home including traditional cyber attacks and adversarial machine learning attacks. CROSS is based on a multi-objective bi-level two-stage optimisation. In stage-one optimisation, the problem is modelled as a multi-leader-follower game that considers both security and economic objectives, where the provider selects a security portfolio to protect both itself and its users, while rational attackers target the weakest path. Stage-two optimisation is a Stackelberg security game that focuses on additional user security controls under the remit of smart home users. While CROSS can potentially be applied to other similar use cases, in this paper, our aim is to address threats against artificial intelligence (AI) applications as the use of AI in smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new cyber threats to home environments. Specifically, we have implemented and assessed CROSS in a smart heating use case in a prototypical AI-enabled IoT environment that combines characteristics and vulnerabilities currently present on existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, demonstrating the selection of optimal decisions.},

   abstract = {In the past, home automation was a small market for technology enthusiasts. Interconnectivity between devices was down to the owner’s technical skills and creativity, while security was non-existent or primitive, because cyber threats were also largely non-existent or primitive. This is not the case any more. The adoption of Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and an increasingly wide range of sensing and actuation capabilities has led to smart homes that are more practical, but also genuinely attractive targets for cyber attacks. Here, we classify applicable cyber threats according to a novel taxonomy, focusing not only on the attack vectors that can be used, but also the potential impact on the systems and ultimately on the occupants and their domestic life. Utilising the taxonomy, we classify twenty five different smart home attacks, providing further examples of legitimate, yet vulnerable smart home configurations which can lead to second-order attack vectors. We then review existing smart home defence mechanisms and discuss open research problems.},

   abstract = {The network of resource constraint devices, also known as the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), constitutes the edge tire of the Internet of Things applications like smart homes, smart cities, and connected vehicles. The IPv6 Routing Protocol over Low power and lossy networks (RPL) ensures efficient routing in the edge tire of the IoT environment. However, RPL has inherent vulnerabilities that allow malicious insider entities to instigate several security attacks in the IoT network. As a result, the IoT networks suffer from resource depletion, performance degradation, and traffic disruption. Recent literature discusses several machine learning algorithms to detect one or more routing attacks. However, IoT infrastructures are expanding, and so are the attack surfaces. Therefore, it is essential to have a solution that can adapt to this change. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to detect routing attacks within Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The proposed solution leverages deep learning by combining Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The framework is trained on 11 network parameters to understand and predict normal network behavior. Anomalies, identified as deviations from the forecast trends, serve as indicators of potential routing attacks and thus address vulnerabilities in the RPL.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used in environmental monitoring, smart home and other fields, and has become a research hotspot in recent years. Due to its distributed nature, IoT is vulnerable to various attacks. In traditional packet attack, malicious nodes will indiscriminately attack packets. The existing detection algorithms can detect the attack by observing the overall behaviour of nodes. In this paper, we introduce an advanced attack named selective-edge packet attack, in which malicious nodes only attack packets sent to specific neighbours. Due to selectively attack packets, the attack is more covert than the traditional packet attack, which makes it difficult for the existing detection algorithms to detect. To detect selective-edge packet attack, we propose machine learning-based detection framework (MDMK) and machine learning-based detection algorithm (MDA) based on the framework, which uses regression algorithm and clustering algorithm to evaluate the reputation of communication links and nodes, and detects malicious nodes accordingly. To further improve the detection performance, machine learning-based detection algorithm with enhancement (MDAE) is designed by optimizing the routing path. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing detection algorithms, the accuracy of MDA and MDAE in different situations is improved by around 7%–30% on average.},

This work also highlights potential features that can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems to detect different types of attacks.

   abstract = {Smart homes, leveraging IoT technology to interconnect various devices and appliances to the internet, enable remote monitoring, automation, and control. However, collecting sensitive personal and business data assets renders smart homes a target for cyberattacks. Anomaly detection is a promising approach for identifying malicious behavior in smart homes. Yet, the current literature primarily discusses IoT-related cyberattacks and gives limited attention to detecting anomalies specific to the smart home context. Furthermore, there is a lack of datasets that accurately represent the complexity inherent in a smart home environment in terms of users with varying levels of expertise and diverse, evolving types of devices. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that focuses on using anomaly detection to identify cyberattacks in smart home environments. The SLR includes an adapted taxonomy that classifies existing anomaly detection methods and a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and future research challenges. Our findings show a growing interest in detecting cyberattacks with anomaly-based models in smart homes using centralized and network-based features. Ensemble and deep learning techniques are popular methods for detecting these anomalies. However, the limited diversity of cyberattacks in existing datasets and the absence of comprehensive datasets representing the complexity of smart home environments call for further research to improve the generalizability of detection models.},
