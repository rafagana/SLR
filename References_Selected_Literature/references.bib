@article{Rizvi2020,
   abstract = {For this research, our primary goal is to define an attack surface for networks utilizing the IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The IoT consists of systems of integrated objects, computing devices, digital, or mechanical machines that are given the ability to transmit and receive the data over a network without the need for human interaction. Each of these devices can operate independently within the existing Internet infrastructure. Issues will continue to increase as devices become more prevalent and continuously evolve to counter newer threats and schemes. The attack surface of a network sums up all penetration points, otherwise known as attack vectors. An attacker or an unauthorized user can take advantage of these attack vectors to penetrate and change or extract data from the threat environment. For this research, we define a threat model that allows us to systematically analyze the security solutions to mitigate potential risks from the beginning of the design phase. By designing an IoT architecture and breaking it down into several zones, we focus on each zone to identify any vulnerability or weaknesses within a system that allows unauthorized privileges, as well as any attacks that can target that area. We also investigate the available IoT devices across several domains (e.g., wellness, industrial, home, etc.) to provide a 1:1 and 1:n mapping across devices, vulnerabilities, and potential security threats based on the subjective assessment.},

   abstract = {The last two decades have experienced a steady rise in the production and deployment of sensing-and-connectivity-enabled electronic devices, replacing "regular"physical objects. The resulting Internet-of-Things (IoT) will soon become indispensable for many application domains. Smart objects are continuously being integrated within factories, cities, buildings, health institutions, and private homes. Approximately 30 years after the birth of IoT, society is confronted with significant challenges regarding IoT security. Due to the interconnectivity and ubiquitous use of IoT devices, cyberattacks have widespread impacts on multiple stakeholders. Past events show that the IoT domain holds various vulnerabilities, exploited to generate physical, economic, and health damage. Despite many of these threats, manufacturers struggle to secure IoT devices properly. Thus, this work overviews the IoT security landscape with the intention to emphasize the demand for secured IoT-related products and applications. Therefore, (a) a list of key challenges of securing IoT devices is determined by examining their particular characteristics, (b) major security objectives for secured IoT systems are defined, (c) a threat taxonomy is introduced, which outlines potential security gaps prevalent in current IoT systems, and (d) key countermeasures against the aforementioned threats are summarized for selected IoT security-related technologies available on the market.},

However, we have to be careful not to repeat the same mistake that was made with home automation technologies that were booming in the 1970s. That is, [total?] automation should not be a goal of smart home technologies. I believe the following points are important in construction of smart homes from users' viewpoints: development of interface technologies between humans and systems for detection of human intensions, feelings, and situations; improvement of system knowledge; and extension of human activity support outside homes to the scopes of communities, towns, and cities},

The current research identifies the development status and trends, country distribution, and journal categories in this area. Then, based on the main topics covered by smart homes, we proposed a holistic research framework that integrates the infrastructure layer, the communications technology layer, the data analytics layer, and the user service layer. The framework analyzed wireless sensing networks, communication protocols, and security threats, as well as the activity identification process and user services, highlighting the lack of some degree of integration in this area. This study also discussed the evolution of hot spots in the field of smart homes and summarized potential future research directions. Finally, in the discussion section, this paper summarized the research contribution and compared the main proposed technical solutions.

   abstract = {Flow monitoring has become a prevalent method for monitoring traffic in high-speed networks. By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of deep packet inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.},

abstract = {Background
In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference.
Aims
This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence.
Method
We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings.
Results
Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4.
Conclusions
Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.}

   abstract = {Context: In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007. Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Besides systematizing the search for relevant studies, the SR predicts the organization and the analysis of the obtained results. However, the SR application is laborious because there are many steps to be followed. Aiming to offer computational support to SR and SM, the StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review) tool was developed. Besides helping the steps of SR or SM, the StArt tool has implemented visualization and text mining techniques to support the conduction and the reporting of the SR or SM.

The methodology is illustrated through its application to five major organizations. The methodology encompasses a model of IQ, a questionnaire to measure IQ, and analysis techniques for interpreting the IQ measures. We develop and validate the questionnaire and use it to collect data on the status of organizational IQ. These data are used to assess and benchmark IQ for four quadrants of the model. These analysis techniques are applied to analyze the gap between an organization and best practices. They are also applied to analyze gaps between IS professionals and information consumers. The results of the techniques are useful for determining the best area for IQ improvement activities. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) allows households to have real-time access to various services such as IP cameras for monitoring home security, automatic climate controls, doors and window access for family members including pets, mood-based home lighting, or automatic refrigerators that tell what item is going to expire at what time, etc. However, IoT has often been considered a single-domain facility that provides services to consumers, but security and privacy issues pertaining to households and residential infrastructure have not been studied thoroughly. The security of IoT -based systems requires a critical engineering infrastructure when dealing with home security. Any proposed home security framework should establish an automatic access monitoring and regular updates of the system software and firmware according to the ongoing threats. In this paper, we provide an insightful short review of security issues in smart home systems. We highlight several popular IoT protocols and provide critical analysis of their performance against various security threats. Mitigation strategies are also presented to reduce the impact of cyberattacks on smart home systems. Furthermore, our analysis shows that DDoS is one of the most common threats to smart home systems. Therefore, we developed an ML-based model to detect DDoS attacks. We employed unique characteristics of IoT traffic to engineer features that enable ML algorithms to accurately classify DDoS traffic from normal/benign traffic. © 2020 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an inevitable part of human life, that includes online learning, smart homes, smart cars, smart grids, smart cities, agriculture, and e-healthcare. It allows us to operate them 24/7 from anywhere. These smart IoT devices streamline our daily lives by automating everything around us. Several security issues have arisen with the continuous growth of non-secure IoT devices. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most prominent security threats to Internet-based services and IoT platforms. It has the potential to break down the victim’s server or network by transferring an immense amount of irrelevant traffic from the pool of compromised IoT devices. In this article, we present: (i) A comprehensive cyberattacks taxonomy for IoT platforms, (ii) Systematically demonstrate IoT technology: evolution, applications, and challenges, (iv) Systematic review of existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based detection approaches for large-scale IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks, (v) Characterize publicly available IoT-traffic-specific datasets, and (vi) Discuss various open research issues with possible solutions for detecting IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks, including future directions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},
