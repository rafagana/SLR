   abstract = {Secure and private communications using the Internet of Things (IoT) pose several challenges for smart home systems. In particular, data collected from IoT devices comprise sensitive personal information such as biomedical data, financial data, and location and activity data. Recent research looks into the use of blockchain in smart home systems, protecting the privacy of the data in use. Such solutions need to address the issue of privacy using a formal and mathematical model for data privacy due to the vulnerability associated with privacy-preserving blockchain networks. In the present paper, our approach aims to provide a privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanism in the context of Smart Homes that agree to contribute their data to a cloud server using machine learning to improve services for home users. We propose the use of differential privacy, a powerful concept in privacy preserving schemes to provide formal assurances about how much information is leaked using a privacy budget. The main purpose of using such a privacy-preserving scheme is to limit what can be inferred about individual training data from the model. Our techniques use a R′enyi differential privacy (RDP) machine learning scheme and are based on a variant of the stochastic gradient descent function. The performance of our proposed framework is evaluated using three public datasets: UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and ToN-IoT datasets. Our findings show that differential private models can provide privacy protection against attackers by sacrificing a substantial amount of model utility. Therefore, we propose an empirical value of ϵ, that can optimally balances utility and privacy for the current smart home scenario datasets.},

   abstract = {Recently, Smart Home Systems (SHSs) have gained enormous popularity with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Besides offering many tangible benefits, SHSs are vulnerable to attacks that lead to security and privacy concerns for SHS users. Machine learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed to address such concerns. Conventionally, ML models are trained and tested on computationally powerful platforms such as cloud services. Nevertheless, the data shared with the cloud is vulnerable to privacy attacks and causes latency, which decreases the performance of real-time applications like intrusion detection systems. Therefore, on-device ML models, in which the user data is kept locally, have emerged as promising solutions to ensure the security and privacy of the data for real-time applications. However, performing ML tasks requires high energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to analyze the energy consumption of ML-based IDS. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of on-device ML algorithms in terms of energy consumption for IoT intrusion detection applications. For a thorough analysis, we study the training and inference phases separately. For training, we compare the cloud computing-based ML, edge computing-based ML, and IoT device-based ML approaches. For the inference, we evaluate the TinyML approach to run the ML algorithms on tiny IoT devices such as Micro Controller Units (MCUs). Comparative performance evaluations show that deploying the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm on-device gives better results in terms of training time, inference time, and power consumption.},

   abstract = {Smart cities, businesses, workplaces, and even residences have all been converged by the Internet of Things (IoT). The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results. The presented model can be used for the real-time security of smart home cyber-physical systems and develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0.},

IoT networks are composed of numerous different Things, arranged in diverse topologies with diverse needs. This diversity is partially due to the numerous areas where IoT applications are utilized, which at their entirety can be referred as the IoT ecosystem. The IoT ecosystem suffers from numerous vulnerabilities, due to reasons such as design flows, hardware limitation or simply human error and is subject to various attacks targeting IoT services, platforms and networks. These attacks can have significant consequences such as economic losses, service disruption or data leaks. Cyber-attacks are an unavoidable and must be faced in tandem with the global growth of IoT networks. An approach that can assist in developing robust, intelligent Cyber-security tools for IoT is using Artificial Intelligence. In the following paper, a mechanism is presented that automatically selects appropriate mitigation actions in an optimal way to countermeasure attacks faced by IoT networks. This is achieved by using an novel Artificial Intelligence mechanism based on a Deep Neural Architecture called Pointer Networks to optimize security-related KPIs. Experimental results, show that the proposed method produces equal or better Pareto optimal solutions, performs faster compared to state-of-the-art (SoA) algorithms and scales better.},

   abstract = {Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories , or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method.},

CROSS is based on a multi-objective bi-level two-stage optimisation. In stage-one optimisation, the problem is modelled as a multi-leader-follower game that considers both security and economic objectives, where the provider selects a security portfolio to protect both itself and its users, while rational attackers target the weakest path. Stage-two optimisation is a Stackelberg security game that focuses on additional user security controls under the remit of smart home users. While CROSS can potentially be applied to other similar use cases, in this paper, our aim is to address threats against artificial intelligence (AI) applications as the use of AI in smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new cyber threats to home environments. Specifically, we have implemented and assessed CROSS in a smart heating use case in a prototypical AI-enabled IoT environment that combines characteristics and vulnerabilities currently present on existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, demonstrating the selection of optimal decisions.},

The rapid development of SRSs is inseparable from the advancement of machine learning, especially neural networks. However, previous work has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the image domain, which inspired researchers to explore adversarial attacks and defenses in Speaker Recognition Systems (SRS). Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review of this topic. In this paper, we fill this gap by performing a comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks and defenses in SRSs. We first introduce the basics of SRSs and concepts related to adversarial attacks. Then, we propose two sets of criteria to evaluate the performance of attack methods and defense methods in SRSs, respectively. After that, we provide taxonomies of existing attack methods and defense methods, and further review them by employing our proposed criteria. Finally, based on our review, we find some open issues and further specify a number of future directions to motivate the research of SRSs security.},

The adoption of Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and an increasingly wide range of sensing and actuation capabilities has led to smart homes that are more practical, but also genuinely attractive targets for cyber attacks. Here, we classify applicable cyber threats according to a novel taxonomy, focusing not only on the attack vectors that can be used, but also the potential impact on the systems and ultimately on the occupants and their domestic life. Utilising the taxonomy, we classify twenty five different smart home attacks, providing further examples of legitimate, yet vulnerable smart home configurations which can lead to second-order attack vectors.

The IPv6 Routing Protocol over Low power and lossy networks (RPL) ensures efficient routing in the edge tire of the IoT environment. However, RPL has inherent vulnerabilities that allow malicious insider entities to instigate several security attacks in the IoT network. As a result, the IoT networks suffer from resource depletion, performance degradation, and traffic disruption. Recent literature discusses several machine learning algorithms to detect one or more routing attacks. However, IoT infrastructures are expanding, and so are the attack surfaces. Therefore, it is essential to have a solution that can adapt to this change. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to detect routing attacks within Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The proposed solution leverages deep learning by combining Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The framework is trained on 11 network parameters to understand and predict normal network behavior. Anomalies, identified as deviations from the forecast trends, serve as indicators of potential routing attacks and thus address vulnerabilities in the RPL.},

Due to its distributed nature, IoT is vulnerable to various attacks. In traditional packet attack, malicious nodes will indiscriminately attack packets. The existing detection algorithms can detect the attack by observing the overall behaviour of nodes. In this paper, we introduce an advanced attack named selective-edge packet attack, in which malicious nodes only attack packets sent to specific neighbours. Due to selectively attack packets, the attack is more covert than the traditional packet attack, which makes it difficult for the existing detection algorithms to detect. To detect selective-edge packet attack, we propose machine learning-based detection framework (MDMK) and machine learning-based detection algorithm (MDA) based on the framework, which uses regression algorithm and clustering algorithm to evaluate the reputation of communication links and nodes, and detects malicious nodes accordingly. To further improve the detection performance, machine learning-based detection algorithm with enhancement (MDAE) is designed by optimizing the routing path. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing detection algorithms, the accuracy of MDA and MDAE in different situations is improved by around 7%–30% on average.},

In this context, low-power radar devices have recently gained in popularity as recording sensors, given that the usage of these devices allows mitigating a number of privacy concerns, a key issue when making use of conventional video cameras. Another concern that is often cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these applications against cyberattacks. It is, for instance, well-known that the combination of images and CNNs is vulnerable against adversarial examples, mischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong classifications during testing time. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these radar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through experiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are susceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose the existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to change the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the padding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself occurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation not randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these important features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network interpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial perturbation and prediction interpretability.},

Anomaly detection is a promising approach for identifying malicious behavior in smart homes. Yet, the current literature primarily discusses IoT-related cyberattacks and gives limited attention to detecting anomalies specific to the smart home context. Furthermore, there is a lack of datasets that accurately represent the complexity inherent in a smart home environment in terms of users with varying levels of expertise and diverse, evolving types of devices. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that focuses on using anomaly detection to identify cyberattacks in smart home environments. The SLR includes an adapted taxonomy that classifies existing anomaly detection methods and a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and future research challenges. Our findings show a growing interest in detecting cyberattacks with anomaly-based models in smart homes using centralized and network-based features. Ensemble and deep learning techniques are popular methods for detecting these anomalies. However, the limited diversity of cyberattacks in existing datasets and the absence of comprehensive datasets representing the complexity of smart home environments call for further research to improve the generalizability of detection models.},

Since IoT devices have limited computing capability, storage, network communication ability, and power supply, they are often vulnerable to cyberattacks when they are deployed in large and complex environments. The digital twin (DT), as a cyber replica of the physical system, is essentially a data-oriented infrastructure that can facilitate the interactions between cyber and physical components, improve the efficiency of IoT systems, and support new services and applications via integrating different IoT systems. In the meantime, DT can be used as a data-oriented architecture to significantly enhance the security of computing and power-constrained IoT devices and improve the security of IoT systems. For example, it can offer predictions to mitigate the potential security impact on the physical subsystems via data analytics based on advanced machine learning (ML) models. In this chapter, we investigate the feasibility of applying DT to secure IoT systems. First, we focus on the study of the layer structure of IoT systems, outline potential threats to IoT systems, and examine the possibility of securing IoT systems using secure DT data services. We create a taxonomy to consider how to apply DT to secure IoT systems from the aspects of DT use, security scope, and security objectives. Furthermore, real threats in IoT systems, such as secure shell protocol (SSH) port brute-force attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, are leveraged in our case studies to demonstrate how DT can protect IoT systems. Finally, we discuss several research directions to secure IoT systems via DT, including DT with self-correction, using a suitable ML model on top of DT, and protecting communications between DT and IoT devices.},
