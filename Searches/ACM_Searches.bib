However, each technology not only brings its advantages, but also the challenges that cities have to face in order to implement it. So, this paper addresses two research questions : « What are the most important technologies that drive the development of smart cities ?» and « what are the challenges that cities will face when adopting these technologies ? » Relying on a literature review of studies published between 1990 and 2017, the ensuing results show that Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things represent the most used technologies for smart cities. So, the focus of this paper will be on these two technologies by showing their advantages and their challenges.},

   abstract = {Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems have been proven to be very effective in the protection of IoT Networks. However, the expansion of Adversarial Machine Learning attacks threatens their efficacy affecting also the security of IoT networks. Thus, this paper proposes a Machine Learning-driven methodology for multiclass classification of cyber-attacks in IoT networks and investigates the robustness of the Machine and Deep Learning classifiers against several well-known Adversarial Machine Learning attacks (JSMA, FGSM, DeepFool). Moreover, the effectiveness of the Adversarial Training defense method has been studied in tackling Adversarial Machine Learning attacks. The proposed methodology was evaluated using a new and large IoT dataset (IoTID20) and the experimental results concluded that the Random Forest classifier can classify the cyber-attacks with high classification accuracy (99.9%) as well as the JSMA, FGSM, and DeepFool attacks can significantly reduce the performance of all the classifiers. Finally, based on the evaluation adversarial training can overall enhance the classifiers’ robustness against all the utilized Adversarial Machine Learning attacks without affecting the performance when only normal samples are present.},

Although this has led to multiple studies in the recent past, there exists a paucity of literature concerning real-time Industrial IoT attack detection. The goal of this article is to build a machine-learning approach using Industrial IoT sensor readings for accurately tracking down Industrial IoT attacks in real time. We analyze IoT system behavior under a lab-controlled series of attacks on a Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. The system is analytically challenging in that it results in sensor readings that resemble waveforms. To that end, we develop a novel early detection method using functional shape analysis (FSA) to extract features from the data that can capture the profile of the waveform. Our results show an efficiency-complexity trade-off between functional and non-functional methods in predicting IoT attacks.},

   abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are effectively utilized in various complicated challenges in healthcare, industry, and academia. The Internet of Drones (IoD) has lately cropped up due to high adjustability to a broad range of unpredictable circumstances. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be utilized efficiently in a multitude of scenarios, including rescue missions and search, farming, mission-critical services, surveillance systems, and so on, owing to technical and realistic benefits such as low movement, the capacity to lengthen wireless coverage zones, and the ability to attain places unreachable to human beings. In many studies, IoD and UAV are utilized interchangeably. Besides, drones enhance the efficiency aspects of various network topologies, including delay, throughput, interconnectivity, and dependability. Nonetheless, the deployment of drone systems raises various challenges relating to the inherent unpredictability of the wireless medium, the high mobility degrees, and the battery life that could result in rapid topological changes. In this paper, the IoD is originally explained in terms of potential applications and comparative operational scenarios. Then, we classify ML in the IoD-UAV world according to its applications, including resource management, surveillance and monitoring, object detection, power control, energy management, mobility management, and security management. This research aims to supply the readers with a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of IoD/UAV, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that need further investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is the most often employed ML method in publications. According to research, most papers are on resource and mobility management. Most articles have focused on enhancing only one parameter, with the accuracy parameter receiving the most attention. Also, Python is the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 90% of the time. Also, in 2021, it has the most papers published.},

Consequently, the interconnected nature of IoT systems and the variety of components of their implementation have given rise to new security concerns. Cyber-attacks and threats in the IoT ecosystem significantly impact the development of new intelligent applications. Moreover, the IoT ecosystem suffers from inheriting vulnerabilities that make its devices inoperable to benefit from instigating security techniques such as authentication, access control, encryption, and network security. Recently, great advances have been achieved in the field of Machine Intelligence (MI), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML), which have been applied to many important applications. ML and DL are regarded as efficient data exploration techniques for discovering “normal” and “abnormal” IoT component and device behavior inside the IoT ecosystem. Therefore, ML/DL approaches are required to convert the security of IoT systems from providing safe Device-to-Device (D2D) communication to providing security-based intelligence systems. The proposed work examines ML/DL technologies that may be utilized to provide superior security solutions for IoT devices. The potential security risks associated with the IoT are discussed, including pre-existing and newly emerging threats. Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of DL and ML techniques are examined to enhance IoT security.},

   abstract = {Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the “physics” data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the “security by obscurity” principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.},

The adoption of activity monitoring in the smart home control system further augments the controller efficiency and improves occupants' comfort and productivity, elderly monitoring, and so forth. Additionally, the learned occupants' activity patterns help embed machine learning (ML)-based abnormality detection capability to track inconsistencies among the zone sensor measurements. Hence, the incorporation of an activity monitoring system assists anomaly detection models (ADMs) in detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks that are being glowingly researched due to their massive damage capability. However, in this work, we propose a novel attack strategy that identified that the knowledge of occupants' activities along with indoor air quality (IAQ) and occupancy sensor measurements allows the attackers to launch even more hazardous attack (i.e., significant increment in energy cost/ worsening health conditions for the occupants). Hence, it is crucial to analyze the security of the activity monitoring-based smart home DCHVAC system. Accordingly, we propose a novel formal threat analyzer that analyzes the threat space of the smart home DCHVAC control system, which is modeled by rule-based control policies and ML-based ADMs. The rules from the ADM are extracted through an efficient algorithm. The constraints associated with the rules are solved through a satisfiability module theorem (SMT)-based solver. %We performed our initial evaluation of the proposed threat analyzer's effectiveness on the Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS) dataset using some metrics. We will further experiment with other metrics along experimenting with our collaborator's dataset (KTH live-in lab) and open-source Örebro datasets for assessing the framework with realistic occupants' activity. Moreover, we also created our prototype testbed for evaluating the feasibility of the proposed attack and threat analyzer.},

Today, almost tens of billions of HDMI devices exist in the world and are widely used to distribute A/V signals in smart homes, offices, concert halls, and sporting events making HDMI one of the most highly deployed systems in the world. An important component in HDMI is the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) protocol, which allows for the interaction between devices within an HDMI distribution network. Nonetheless, existing network security mechanisms only protect traditional networking components, leaving CEC outside of their scope. In this work, we identify and tap into CEC protocol vulnerabilities, using them to implement realistic proof-of-work attacks on HDMI distribution networks. We study, how current insecure CEC protocol practices and carelessly implemented HDMI distributions may grant an adversary a novel attack surface for HDMI devices otherwise thought to be unreachable through traditional means. To introduce this novel attack surface, in this paper, we present HDMI-Walk, which opens a realm of remote and local CEC attacks to HDMI devices. Specifically, with HDMI-Walk, an attacker can perform malicious analysis of devices, eavesdropping, Denial of Service attacks, targeted device attacks, and even facilitate other well-known existing attacks through HDMI. With HDMI-Walk, we prove that it is feasible for an attacker to gain arbitrary control of HDMI devices. We demonstrate the implementations of both local and remote attacks with commodity HDMI devices including Smart TVs and Media Players. Our work aims to uncover vulnerabilities in a very well deployed system like HDMI distributions. The consequences of which can largely impact HDMI users as well as other systems which depend on these distributions. Finally, we discuss security mechanisms to provide impactful and comprehensive security evaluation to these real-world systems while guaranteeing deployability and providing minimal overhead, while considering the current limitations of the CEC protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work solely investigating the security of HDMI device distribution networks.},

   abstract = {Recent global smart city efforts resemble the establishment of electricity networks when electricity was first invented, which meant the start of a new era to sell electricity as a utility. A century later, in the smart era, the network to deliver services goes far beyond a single entity like electricity. Supplemented by a well-established Internet infrastructure that can run an endless number of applications, abundant processing and storage capabilities of clouds, resilient edge computing, and sophisticated data analysis like machine learning and deep learning, an already-booming Internet of Things movement makes this new era far more exciting.In this article, we present a multi-faceted survey of machine intelligence in modern implementations. We partition smart city infrastructure into application, sensing, communication, security, and data planes and put an emphasis on the data plane as the mainstay of computing and data storage. We investigate (i) a centralized and distributed implementation of data plane’s physical infrastructure and (ii) a complementary application of data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization to implement robust machine intelligence in a smart city software core. We finalize our article with pointers to open issues and challenges.},

The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

IoT devices are often connected to networks and to the internet, making them potential targets for cyberattacks (e.g., Mirai attack). As the IoT ecosystem grows, there’s a pressing need to enhance cybersecurity measures to ensure the protection of these interconnected devices and the data they handle. On the other hand, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves the collection, analysis, and distribution of information about potential and ongoing cyber threats. CTI helps organizations understand the threat landscape and take proactive measures to mitigate risks. In the context of IoT, having timely and accurate CTI is crucial for identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities. While sharing CTI knowledge is important, doing so in a distributed IoT environment presents challenges. The data generated and collected by IoT devices can be sensitive and private, making it essential to find ways to share CTI knowledge without compromising data privacy. This research focuses on leveraging Federated Learning (FL) techniques to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving CTI knowledge sharing in IoT networks by proposing a solution called FedCTI. This paper explores the potential benefits, architecture, experiments, and challenges associated with using FL for sharing CTI knowledge to secure IoT systems.},

Digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. Hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. Foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. Developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.},

   abstract = {IoT devices can monitor the health, safety, and security of aging adults, and automate many household tasks, enabling independence far into old age. However, such devices also have many inherent vulnerabilities, which make them a popular target for cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices and their interactions may make them susceptible to new types of attacks, and also make usability difficult for the aging population. Furthermore, the elderly may be particularly vulnerable and uncomfortable with new technologies. Existing network management interfaces are designed for domain experts, and are impracticable for non-technical users. We propose an agenda for exploring the design of (1) interfaces and guidelines to enable senior users to manage the security posture of IoT devices, and (2) security tools that identify such issues and collaborate with the user to resolve them. We structure this agenda around the core concepts of autonomy, control, and delegation, summarized by the concept of explainable stewardship. We argue that goal (1) must be addressed with qualitative studies of user attitudes towards prototype interfaces. Goal (2) requires the integration of existing network anomaly detection algorithms into techniques which can summarize and explain their meaning. Much remains to be done to ensure older users can take advantage of smart devices without suffering cybersecurity incidents. We hope this article can act as a call for further research in this field.},

The home network is at a vantage point for deploying security appliances to deal with such IoT attacks. We propose a comprehensive home network defense, Pot2DPI, and use it to raise an attacker's uncertainty about devices and enable the home network to monitor traffic, detect anomalies, and filter malicious packets. The security offered by Pot2DPI comes from a synthesis of practical techniques: honeypot, deep packet inspection (DPI), and a realization of moving target defense (MTD) in port forwarding. In particular, Pot2DPI has a chain of honeypot and DPI that collects suspicious packet traces, acquires attack signatures, and installs filtering rules at a home router timely. Meanwhile, Pot2DPI shuffles the mapping of ports between the router and the devices connected to it, making a targeted attack difficult and defense more effective. Pot2DPI is our first step towards securing a smart home.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a complex network comprising interconnected devices that transmit their data via the Internet. Due to their open environment, limited computation power, and absence of built-in security, IoT environments are susceptible to various cyberattacks. Denial of service (DDoS) attacks are among the most destructive types of threats. The Multi-vector DDoS attack is a contemporary and formidable form of DDoS wherein the attacker employs a collection of compromised IoT devices as zombies to initiate numerous DDoS attacks against a target server. A Blockchain-based Operational Threat Intelligence framework, OTI-IoT, is proposed in this paper to counter multi-vector DDoS attacks in IoT networks. A ”Prevent-then-Detect” methodology was utilized to deploy the OTI-IoT framework in two distinct stages. During Phase 1, the consortium Blockchain network validators employ the IPS module, composed of a smart contract for attack prevention &amp; access control, and Proof of Voting consensus, to thwart attacks. Validators are outfitted with deep learning-based IDS instances to detect multi-vector DDoS attacks during Phase 2. Alert messages are generated by the IDS module’s alert generation &amp; propagation smart contract in response to identifying malicious IoT sources. The feedback loop from the IDS module to the IPS module prevents incoming traffic from malicious sources. The proposed OTI framework capabilities are realized as an outcome of combining and storing the outcomes of the IDS and IPS modules on the consortium Blockchain. Each validator maintains a shared ledger containing information regarding threat sources to ensure robust security, transparency, and integrity. The operational execution of OTI-IoT occurs on an individual Ethereum Blockchain. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed framework is most suitable for real-time applications due to its ability to lower attack detection time, decreased block validation time, and higher attack prevention rate.},

Countries around the world are increasingly deploying large wind farms that can generate a significant amount of clean energy. A wind farm consists of many turbines, often spread across a large geographical area. Modern wind turbines are equipped with meteorological sensors. The wind farm control center monitors the turbine sensors and adjusts the power generation parameters for optimal power production. The turbine sensors are prone to cyberattacks and with the evolving of large wind farms and their share in the power generation, it is crucial to analyze such potential cyber threats. In this paper, we present a formal framework to verify the impact of false data injection attack on the wind farm meteorological sensor measurements. The framework designs this verification as a maximization problem where the adversary's goal is to maximize the wind farm power production loss with its limited attack capability. Moreover, the adversary wants to remain stealthy to the wind farm bad data detection mechanism while it is launching its cyberattack on the turbine sensors. We evaluate the proposed framework for its threat analysis capability as well as its scalability by executing experiments on synthetic test cases.},

However, existing vehicular networks do not meet current security requirements. Typically for dynamic networks, maximal decentralization and rapidly changing topology of moving hosts form a number of security issues associated with ensuring access control of hosts, security policy enforcement, and resistance of the routing methods. To solve these problems generally, the paper reviews SDN (software defined networks) based network security architectures of VANET. The following tasks are solved in our work: composing of network security architectures for SDN-VANET (architecture with the central control and shared security servers, decentralized (zoned) architecture, hierarchical architecture); implementation of these architectures in virtual modeling environment; and experimental study of effectiveness of the suggested architectures. With large-scale vehicular networks, architectures with multiple SDN controllers are most effective. In small networks, the architecture with the central control also significantly outperforms the traditional VANET architecture. For the suggested architectures, three control modes are discussed in the paper: central, distributed and hybrid modes. Unlike common architectures, all of the proposed security architectures allow us to establish a security policy in m2m-networks and increase resistance capabilities of self-organizing networks.},

   abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

   abstract = {Rule learning based intrusion detection systems (IDS) regularly collect and process network traffic, and thereafter they apply rule learning algorithms to the data to identify network communication behaviors represented as IF-THEN rules. Detection rules are inferred offline and can be periodically automatically updated online for intrusion detection. In this context, we implement in the present paper various attacks against MQTT in a carefully designed and very realistic experiment environment, instead of a simulation program as commonly seen in previous works, for data generation. Besides, we investigate a Bayesian rule learning based approach as countermeasure, which is able to detect various attack types. A Bayesian network is learned from training data and subsequently translated into a rule set for intrusion detection. The combination of prior knowledge (about the communication protocol and target system) and data help to efficiently learn the Bayesian network. The translation from the Bayesian network to a set of inherently interpretable rules can be regarded as a transformation from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge. We show that our proposed method can achieve not only good detection performance but also high interpretability.},

We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},
