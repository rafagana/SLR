   abstract = {The increasing demand for renewable energy has led to a surge in popularity for microgrids. Along with this demand, there is a growing pressure to integrate renewable energy trading platforms into these microgrids. To meet these needs, microgrids are now equipped with modern technological applications such as advanced Smart home systems, interconnected local area networks, and Blockchain technology. These technologies not only optimize system management and maintenance efficiency but also provide a secure platform for transactions and data within a blockchain-enabled community housing setting. In order to ensure the security and transparency of automated energy trading within microgrids, the use of smart contracts is necessary. These digital contracts, utilizing blockchain technology, ensure that all parties involved agree to the terms of the trade. By utilizing blockchain technology, smart contracts guarantee transparency and security, eliminating the need for intermediaries within the microgrid. This approach, presented in [1], suggests a smart contract for energy trading in community housing and ensures the accuracy of information on power production and consumption by the central home miner. The incorporation of blockchain technology and smart contracts in microgrids not only promotes the adoption of renewable energy but also has significant practical implications for efficiency and safety in energy management and maintenance systems.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that malicious adversaries are capable of fingerprinting Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a smart home and further causing privacy breaches. However, many existing anti-fingerprinting schemes, either by traffic padding or traffic mutation, are less effective in defending against state-of-the-art fingerprinting methods. To meet this gap, we in this paper propose the HomeSentinel, an intelligent anti-fingerprinting scheme to counter IoT traffic fingerprinting in smart homes. Specifically, we first design a LightGBM-based IoT traffic extraction model to accurately distinguish IoT traffic from raw network traffic in a smart home without user operations. Second, we develop a dummy IoT traffic generation model to produce dummy IoT traffic in desired spatial-temporal patterns. Third, an IoT traffic mixing strategy is crafted to heuristically merge dummy IoT traffic with real IoT traffic in desired spatial-temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (i.e., two public and one custom) demonstrate that our proposed HomeSentinel scheme can effectively defend against state-of-the-art IoT traffic fingerprinting methods, and outperforms existing IoT traffic anti-fingerprinting schemes. Further, real-world experiments are conducted on a self-built testbed show that, reasonably low communication delays can be caused when implementing the HomeSentinel in smart homes.},

Smartphones allow homeowners to remotely operate these devices and monitor and manage their homes in real time. Smart home devices use IoT to make life smarter, more effective, and more customized. Smart home IoT devices may be hacked to access security cameras and personal data. Attackers might manipulate smart locks or thermostats, threatening people and their property. These IoT devices are networked, making strong cybersecurity necessary to guard against emerging threats. Early cybersecurity identification enables quick reaction and remediation, limiting damage and averting attack escalation. Early detection of security breaches allows proactive actions to stop unwanted access, limit the effect, and protect critical data. It dramatically minimizes the window of vulnerability, improving cybersecurity resilience and safeguarding systems from protracted exploitation or criminal activity. This research improves smart home security by training Aposemat IoT-23 dataset. XGBoost, Simple Neural Network, GaussianNB and Logistic Regression are evaluated to identify and prevent harmful data injection and illegal access. The results show they protect smart home networks with over 99% accuracy. Smart home IoT device protection is excellent with machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Simple Neural Network.

These concerns impose a high level of security; unfortunately, IoT devices usually have limited resources in terms of little memory, low computing power, and a short battery life. Therefore, IoT application developers must use lightweight cryptographic tools to achieve a trade-off between performance and security. The storage and high computation capacity of cloud computing is often exploited to manage the vast amount of data produced by such gadgets. Some methods still suffer from attacks, and others cannot achieve low complexity. We propose a secure and low-complexity system for smart buildings in transferring data between the local server, the cloud, and users authorized by the owner. The LED encryption algorithm, which is lightweight and requires limited resources and less energy, was used to create a mobile application system characterized by confidentiality, authentication, and privacy. For further security, the owner's biometrics were used and derived as the key to decrypt data from the cloud. We have leveraged Dragonfly authentication technology to transfer data from the local server to the users. The owner can add authorized persons in the cloud database and local server to enjoy using the application. Moreover, we successfully balance security complexity and performance in our work. As a result, we achieve good results with a computation cost of 0.281 s and a communication cost of 1472 bit.},

   abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to the rising popularity of Smart Home Automation (SHAuto). SHAuto uses a variety of interconnected smart devices to provide life-enhancing services such as smart energy control, smart entertainment, smart healthcare, and so on. If these devices are compromised, sensitive data may be disclosed and the compromised devices or other connected devices may be maliciously controlled, threatening the privacy and safety of home occupants. Therefore, controlling access to devices in SHAuto is of paramount importance. However, due to the characteristics of the SHAuto environment, this has become a challenging issue. As a first step towards addressing this challenging issue, this paper provides a comprehensive problem analysis of SHAuto. The problem analysis consists of two parts. The first part is an in-depth analysis of various SHAuto use case scenarios covering three aspects, i.e., device control modes, automation modes, and device communications. This analysis has led to the formulation of a generic model for SHAuto. Based on this model, the second part analyses potential vulnerabilities and threats in relation to authorisation. The comprehensive problem analysis has led to a hypothesis that access to the devices can be controlled by governing device communications and the specification of a set of requirements for the design of secure and usable communication-based access control solutions for SHAuto environments.},

Big data analytics and Deep learning (DL) have considerable potential in developing and designing strong security systems for IIoT networks.

The MSDF-CDGSO technique examines the IIoT data for identifying the existence of cyberattacks in the IIoT environment. In the presented MSDF-CDGSO technique, the IIoT devices collect data from different devices and fused them together. At the preliminary stage, the MSDF-CDGSO technique preprocesses the input data to scale them properly. For cyberattack detection, the MSDF-CDGSO technique uses class-specific cost regulation extreme learning machine (CCR-ELM) model. Finally, the GSO method is exploited to adjust the parameter values of the CCR-ELM algorithm. The simulation result analysis of the MSDF-CDGSO method is investigated on benchmark database.

Due to memory and processing limitations, IoT devices face security vulnerabilities. Several rule-based detection approaches are vulnerable. Many rule-based detection systems are also attackable. This research proposes a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system using network traffic data from five smart home IoT devices under attack. The “Gafgyt” and “Mirai” botnet attacks against IoT devices were categorized into five. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) ML algorithms were used to identify attack from benign traffic data in over a million records from individual devices utilizing 115 factors. The best feature analysis was done utilizing the RF method to improve model correctness and processing speed. With 99.99% accuracy, 99.87% precision, 99.79% recall, and 99.89% AUROC rating, RF is superior. Experimental results show that our approach can efficiently identify botnet attacks in network traffic.},

A common cyber intrusion in smart home networks is the compromise of IoT devices by malware to form botnets; furthermore, most proposed solutions lack domain adaptation, struggling to generalize to related distributions. Although deep learning has shown remarkable success in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition as adaptive solutions. Nevertheless, it has its limitations in other domains, such as network security, because deep learning has the ability to work mainly with homogeneous unstructured datasets, in contrast to heterogeneous structured datasets. Despite efforts to address this with deep learning models for structured data (tabular data), gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) like XGBoost still outperform in this domain. However, recent empirical research indicated the significant impact of incorporating domain knowledge for training models that yield high F-1 scores on independent datasets compared to other models without incorporating domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to develop an adaptive flow-based NIDS for smart home networks based on XGBoost combined with Rough Set Theory. The proposed approach is evaluated using the AUC-ROC Curve, Accuracy, and F1 score metrics, including assessment on independent data points. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our adaptive flow-based NIDS by combining XGBoost with acquired knowledge from Rough Set Theory.},

In this study, we design and analyze a motion detector for integrated home security using four passive infrared sensors. When the passive infrared sensor module detects motion, the detection results will provide a motion detection notification, which will be sent to the homeowner’s smartphone via the Blynk application. The dataset was split 70:30. Dataset test was performed using the bagging method to determine the data matrix. The test results revealed the highest values for the bagging method in Confusion Matrix calculations before and after tuning. The bagging method has five classifiers: Random Forest, Extra Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Ridge, and requires more computation time compared to using fewer classifiers. The confusion matrix values for the test data after tuning show 95.7% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the proposed prototype can be used as a home security model.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can effectively manage the heterogeneity of IoT devices. The applications of AIT are seen in various verticals, including smart homes/offices, smart factories, Industrial IoT, precision agriculture, etc. In particular, AIT has been a huge asset to the farming sector. Smart farm monitoring requires a huge number of sensors deployed in the monitoring field that measure various physical parameters such as humidity, soil moisture, temperature, etc. However, the main challenge is to handle the vulnerability of sensor node failure due to any natural calamity. This leads to the malfunctioning of sensor modules, which degrades the performance of the network. Also, sensor nodes are battery-limited. It is difficult to recharge and replace the sensors frequently. This article proposes an AI-based hyperparameter-tuned least square support vector machine (HT-LS-SVM) for fault diagnosis that detects faults with high accuracy. Also, it proposes mobile sink that applies reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to perform obstacle-aware path planning. This algorithm adds self-learning capability to the mobile sink, which makes the system autonomous and improves network lifetime significantly. The simulation and testbed results depict the outperformance of the proposed scheme in terms of false detection accuracy (FDA), false alarm rate (FAR), false-positive rate (FPR), F1 score, network lifetime, latency, and energy consumption.},

In this paper, a two-layer malware spread−patch model  IIPV  is proposed based on a hybrid patches distribution method according to the simple edge equipments and limited central computer resources of IIoT. The spread process of malware in IIoT was deeply analyzed using differential game and a differential game model was established. Then optimization theory was further used to solve the optimization problem extracted by introducing subjective effort parameters to obtain the optimal control strategies of devices for malware and patches. In addition, we combined the deep reinforcement learning algorithm into the model  IIPV  to design a new algorithm  DDQN-PV  suitable for suppressing the spread of malware in IIoT during the experiments. Finally, the effectiveness of model  IIPV  and algorithm  DDQN-PV  are verified by numerous comparative experiments.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a technology enabler to enhance the urban physical architecture and render public services. But, public access to accumulated heterogeneous IoT urban information is prone to hackers attacking connected devices to the internet intellectual property as well. IoT security serves a dynamic part in the smart city. Some IoT devices are connected in smart homes, and these connections were centred on gateways. In smart homes, the gateways gain a lot of significance; but their centralized structure causes many security vulnerabilities like availability, integrity, and certification. Unified “cloud-like” computing networks and Blockchain (BC) type systems should be used to sort out these problems. Therefore, this article develops a Blockchain-Assisted Secure Smart Home Network using Gradient Based Optimizer with Hybrid Deep Learning (BSSHN-GBOHDL) model. The presented BSSHN-GBOHDL technique employs BC technology to improve the confidentiality of the data in the smart home environment. In addition, the BSSHN-GBOHDL technique identifies malicious activities in the smart home environment via three sub-processes namely data preprocessing, hybrid deep learning (HDL)-based malicious activity classification, and GBO-based hyperparameter tuning. The GBO algorithm assists in the proficient hyperparameter selection of the HDL model, which aids in accomplishing increased detection efficiency. The experimental validation of the BSSHN-GBOHDL approach is tested on a benchmark NSL-KDD dataset with 65495 normal and 60743 attack samples. The results highlight the betterment of the BSSHN-GBOHDL approach over other recent methods with maximum accuracy of 98.29%.},

As a consequence, preserving the data privacy and security of these applications is of utmost importance. In this respect, a modelling technique for identifying potential data privacy threats and specifying countermeasures to mitigate the related vulnerabilities in such AI-based systems plays a significant role in preserving and securing personal data. Various threat modelling techniques have been proposed such as STRIDE, LINDDUN, and PASTA but none of them is sufficient to model the data privacy threats in autonomous systems. Furthermore, they are not designed to model compliance with data protection legislation like the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is fundamental to protecting data owners’ privacy as well as to preventing personal data from potential privacy-related attacks. In this article, we survey the existing threat modelling techniques for data privacy threats in autonomous systems and then analyse such techniques from the viewpoint of GDPR compliance.

Such devices are now part of our everyday’s life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.},

The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 μs. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 μs. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature.

   abstract = {IoT is a technology that provides many conveniences for humans. Behind this sophisticated technology needs a security system that can maintain network connectivity and data. Security in IoT has begun to be widely studied along with the outbreak of IoT devices used from smart homes to smart industries. IoT devices have limitations on their hardware performance. These devices are elementary to be disturbed by attackers through the internet network. Therefore, finding the attack's source as early as possible is imperative. An attack source that can be detected quickly will avoid a fatal impact on the survival of IoT devices. Availability is what is expected in IoT data connectivity. This paper proposes using an intelligent system based on particle swarm optimization algorithms to detect attacks as early as possible. From the results obtained, this algorithm can detect the source of the attack even though it takes up more bandwidth than traditional schemes. This method can support the functionality of the intrusion prevention system in the next-generation firewall. This attack detection system is a must on all modern IoT devices.},

The three main components of the system are as follows: This involves three steps: 1) determining and profiling the typical activity of each IoT device in the network; 2) spotting malicious packets delivered across the network during an attack; and 3) classifying the assault. We put it through its paces using a battery of eight standard-issue smart-home gadgets. The effectiveness of the proposed IDS architecture is evaluated using a battery of twelve attacks that collectively represent the four most common types of network-based attacks: denial of service, man-in-the-middle/spoofing, reconnaissance, and replay. Additionally, four distinct multi-stage attack scenarios with complex causal chains are used to evaluate the system's performance. The F-measure is based on how successfully the system carries out its three core activities, which are: 1) 96.2%; 2) 90%; and 3) 98.0%.},

   abstract = {IoT environments are highly diverse with regard to devices, applications, and communications protocols. Consequently, they are highly vulnerable to many new attacks specific to this particular network. Existing Intrusion detection systems have shown their inefficiency in loT and this is for many reasons related basically to the limited computation capability of the devices, their mobility, the inherent Internet connectivity, and the large scale of the IoT network. Thus, a lightweight and efficient intrusion detection system designed for loT is required. Inspired by the success of Machine Learning in many fields and its potential in attack detection, we propose in this paper an intrusion detection system for Smart Home. The main goal is to design a model that detects different attacks on different Smart Home devices. We aim to enhance the detection capabilities of our IDS by exploring different features allowing us to classify the input traffic as benign or malicious. More importantly, we seek to develop specific models to predict the type of attacks per device. To this end, we trained two ML and two DL models using an loT dataset named 10T/IIoT. The obtained results show that the ML algorithms trained after applying a feature selection technique outperforms the model where all features are used in the training. Besides, the ML models allow reaching accuracy values competing with the accuracy of DL models, further, they outperform DL models for some devices/attacks.},

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a basic and essential security mechanism to detect malicious traffic. In the literature, in addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, many deep learning schemes have been examined to enhance the detection performance. However, insufficient amounts of labeled samples are still a challenge for real-world implementation, especially in some scenarios such as smart home and Internet of Vehicles. To address this issue, we explore transfer learning as a promising solution. In this work, we develop TDL-IDS, a transfer deep learning based IDS that can work with limited labeled data items. Our approach first uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model on the source domain and then leverages transfer learning to continue the training process on the target domain. In the evaluation, we use NSL-KDD as the source domain, and AWID as the target domain. Our results indicate that TDL-IDS can outperform many similar approaches.},

For this purpose, multiple sensors support attaining comprehensive learning of the physical locomotion in order to avoid confidentiality violations.

The objective of this research is to assist in recognizing locomotion based on a pre-classification technique for patterns identification, which includes static and kinematic patterns cognition.

While one tends to demonstrate that the user needs to have total control of the system he/she is using, the other aims to create mathematical models that automate as much as possible, to give the user the "feeling" that the system has a brain and can think on its own. In the current work, we want to demonstrate that there is more than one possible meeting point between those two research fields, without diminishing the two ideologies. To do so we propose both the adoption of End-User Development techniques (that is a branch of the Human-Computer Interaction) to collect data, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence models, to support the user in performing the right choice. Additionally, we also propose and discuss a couple of scenarios, specifically the programming of internet of things devices in a smart home environment, and check that the related configurations do not expose the user to potential external cyber-attacks. We will not provide any specific solution (with data and/or simulations), rather we want to discuss the potential collaboration between EUD and AI.},

However, IoT devices are vulnerable due to their inadequate security defense mechanisms and increasing security vulnerabilities during rapid proliferation. A bi-layer intrusion detection system (IDS) based on device behavior profiling is proposed in this paper for smart home IoT networks. The system is composed of a supervised learning model and a novel rule set module, which enable the IDS to conduct detection duties more rapidly and accurately. The proposed IDS accomplishes three main functions: 1) detect malicious network traffic targeted at IoT devices, 2) reveal the attack types represented by malicious traffic, and 3) automatically construct the rule set reflecting benign device behaviors to expedite detection. A testbed is established to capture network traffic from real smart home IoT devices in order to conduct device profile investigations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed IDS, a unique test dataset is constructed. False Alarm Rate (FAR) and Missing Alarm Rate (MAR) values are calculated for evaluation. The system performance is evaluated in terms of detection and classification accuracy. The accuracy of detection is shown by FAR and MAR, both of which can reach 0%. The accuracy of classification is given by the F1 score, which can reach 99.51%.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) as an area of tremendous impact, potential, and growth has emerged with the advent of smart homes, smart cities, and smart everything. In the age of IoT, edge devices have taken on greater importance, driving the need for more intelligence and advanced services at the network edge. Since edge devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, they are easy to compromise, more exposed to attackers, and more vulnerable than standard computing systems such as PCs and servers. While several software-based countermeasures have been proposed, they require high computing power and resources that edge devices do not possess. Moreover, modern threats have become more complex and severe, requiring a level of security that can only be provided at the hardware level. In this paper, we realize an efficient hardware-assisted attack detection mechanism for edge devices through effective High Level Synthesize (HLS) optimization techniques. To this end, we propose OptiEdge, a machine learning-guided hardware-assisted resource and timing estimation tool that can effectively reduce the design space exploration for edge devices’ design. This is achieved by analyzing suitability of different machine learning algorithms used for detection and how they affect hardware implementation overheads. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy, performance, and hardware efficiency of different ML algorithms, our work can assist researchers investigating this field of cybersecurity.},

However, a lack of coherency and cross-compatibility in IoT deployments has lead to increasing redundancy and waste of resources. To combat this, various concepts have been proposed for an open IoT search engine (IoT-SE) that serves human and machine users. Invariably, the IoT-SE envisions distributed query retrieval to handle massive volumes of devices and data. Incorporating the massively heterogeneous protocols and properties of devices deployed, the search of such a system for timely and pertinent data is massively challenging, to provide useful knowledge and service for IoT systems. Moreover, enabling and maintaining security and privacy in an IoT-SE is likewise a prodigious task, as end users, IoT devices, and the search system itself, have different protocols and requirements. To this end, a study of security issues in IoT search is conducted to outline the challenges ahead, and a case study to resolve practical security vulnerabilities in an IoT-SE system is carried out. The pertinent issues of security in an IoT-SE system are reviewed. Particularly: 1) a taxonomy is detailed for IoT-SE security issues; 2) the vulnerabilities of machine learning (ML) models in the IoT-SE are considered; and 3) defensive mechanisms are presented for securing IoT Search. A case study is carried out to implement basic security features in the IoT search, addressing the risk of false queries through the design of ML-based solutions. Finally, a roadmap for future research is provided, including the security and privacy for IoT systems connected to the IoT-SE, distributed edge computing in IoT-SE, privacy-preserving data markets in IoT-SE, and distributed ML in IoT-SE.},

However, these applications can be vulnerable to attacks by adversarial examples. The first contribution of this article is the development of a white-box adversarial attack mechanism to generate adversarial examples for data obtained from smart meters installed in residential houses. For the second contribution, we present an analysis to demonstrate that the statistical properties of adversarial datapoints are indistinguishable from those of the true datapoints. The attack is developed specifically for deep-learning-based models used to perform appliance classification in smart home environments. The statistical indistinguishability of the adversarial datapoints from the true datapoints indicates that non ML-based solutions may not be able to tackle the challenge posed by adversarial examples. As the final contribution, we evaluate the effectiveness of defence mechanisms for white-box adversarial attacks on the proposed attack mechanism, and show that while they can reduce the potency of the attack, the original models still remain significantly affected by the adversarial attack. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: 1) United Kingdom-domestic appliance-level electricity smart meter data set and 2) the Personalized Retrofit Decision Support Tools For U.K. Homes Using Smart Home Technology data set.},

Specifically, a different version of the model will be generated and applied for each device class since the characteristics of the network traffic from each device class may have subtle variation(s). As a case study, we explain how devices in a typical smart home environment can be categorized into four different classes (and in our context, Class 1—very high level of traffic predictability, Class 2—high level of traffic predictability, Class 3—medium level of traffic predictability, and Class 4—low level of traffic predictability). Findings from our evaluations show that the accuracy of our proposed approach is between 99.92% and 99.99% for these four device classes. In other words, we demonstrate that we can use device classes to help us more effectively detect DDoS traffic.},

However, smart homes are vulnerable to many cyberattacks, and the most striking one is energy theft. Researchers have developed many countermeasures, fostered by advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Nevertheless, recent advances are not robust enough in practice, partially due to the vulnerabilities of employed ML algorithms. Given a group of smart homes, in this article, we present a covert electricity theft strategy through mimicking normal consumption patterns and compromising neighboring meters concurrently. Such attack is almost impossible to be detected by existing solutions as the manipulated data have little deviation against honest usage records. To address this threat, we initially identify and define two levels of consumption deviations: home-level and interpersonal-level, respectively. Then, we design a feature extraction scheme that can capture the correlation between attacks and honest customers. Finally, we develop a new deep learning-based detection model. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that the presented attack could evade existing mainstream detectors but still gain high profits. In addition, the proposed countermeasure outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods.},

   abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.},

Furthermore, IoT devices owned by employees can unknowingly endanger the security and integrity of the network from other IoT entities they are connected to. Fortunately, IoT devices of the same type tend to have similar vulnerabilities making attack prevention more manageable. Thus, identifying the device types is crucial for IoT security. This paper presents an approach to building a classifier to identify different types of IoT devices using various machine learning techniques. While most existing empirical studies use network traffic data, we use communication protocol data. The paper describes the data collection/treatment, the experiments using four machine learning techniques and compares our proposed approach with an existing work based on the Jaccard similarity measure. The results show that both approaches have competitive accuracy of up to 99% but the Jaccard approach does not scale well (e.g., about 1000 times more than the training time of our approach).},

In this paper, we propose a segmentation based anomaly detection method that converts unsupervised time-series data into a supervised format, and then trains a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to detect anomalies. The LSTM network is trained to predict un-sound statistical properties, which gets combined with sound statistical properties, to detect anomalies in IoT sensor data. Data smoothing using Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing is also performed, without loss of information, to improve anomaly detector performance. Using Precision, Recall, and F-Measure scores as metrics, results show efficient anomaly detection performance on IoT temperature sensor data. We, additionally, test performance by varying specific parameters. Lastly, results also show that performing data smoothing, to a certain extent, can improve anomaly detection performance over data that didn’t undergo any smoothing.},

IIoT has several applications in smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, connected cars, and supply chain management. However, these systems are being more frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Deep learning and big data analytics have great potential in designing and developing robust security mechanisms for IIoT networks. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep random neural network (HDRaNN) for cyberattack detection in the IIoT is presented. The HDRaNN combines a deep random neural network and a multilayer perceptron with dropout regularization. The proposed technique is evaluated using two IIoT security-related datasets: (i) DS2OS and (ii) UNSW-NB15. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through a number of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, Region of Convergence (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The HDRaNN classified 16 different types of cyberattacks using with higher accuracy of 98% and 99% for DS2OS and UNSW-NB15, respectively. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the performance metrics are also compared with several state-of-the-art attack detection algorithms. The findings of HDRaNN proved its superior performance over other DL-based schemes. The deployment perspective of the proposed work is also highlighted in this work.},

To achieve this, we derived time-distance based features that have higher attack success rates than in previous studies. The proposed attack method defines 6 features, and evaluates the performance based on 18 datasets. For performance evaluation, the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC of Datasets (1 to 3) were compared, and two experiments showed improved overall performance by at least 10.6 % and up to 16.1 % compared to previous studies in terms of the performance evaluation for each feature, comparison of variations in maximum performance, comparison of variations in performance of each feature, and comparison of variations in overall performance. Moreover, the best accuracy, which represents the probability of password exposure, was 96.7 %, which suggests that our proposed attack method has a higher accuracy than the previous study (96.2 %). In conclusion, we demonstrated that password authentication is neutralized by stealing the user password more effectively. For future research, we will focus on improving the attack success rate with respect to accuracy and overall performance numbers, using not only machine learning, but also deep learning.},

   abstract = {The modern Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home is a challenging environment to secure: devices change, new vulnerabilities are discovered and often remain unpatched, and different users interact with their devices differently and have different cyber risk attitudes. A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.},

To address the security challenges of IoT systems in smart homes, this paper introduces IoTArgos, a multi-layer security monitoring system, which collects, analyzes, and characterizes data communications of heterogeneous IoT devices via programmable home routers. More importantly, this system extracts a variety of multi-layer data communication features and develops supervised learning methods for classifying intrusion activities at system, network, and application layers. In light of the potential zero-day or unknown attacks, IoTArgos also incorporates unsupervised learning algorithms to discover unusual or suspicious behaviors towards smart home IoT systems.

Each connectivity opens the door to new possibilities to make a person's life easier and convenient. A smart home is one such area impacted by IoT which greatly improves a person's life by helping them create a secure environment for his family and carry out his day-to-day activities with ease. Focusing primarily in the context of Nepal where available smart systems are either expensive or lack basic features, this paper essentially deals with the design and implementation of a cost-efficient smart home system focusing on remote surveillance, monitoring different aspects (movement detections, surveillance and temperature and humidity) of a home with notification alerts. Furthermore, the system also aims to reduce electricity usage and minimize energy consumption by helping a person automate their everyday tasks such as turning on/off lights, thermostats, etc. by detecting their presence. Raspberry Pi is the heart of the home system managing all of these services. In addition, Amazon Cloud Services, Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) are used for notifying users/home-owners. The product could further be regarded as a prototype and additional features could be added on top of it to create one's own version of “smart home”.},

Over the past few years, devices such as Smart Cameras have been used to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks wherein attackers exploit weakly configured IoT devices and inject malicious code after discovering their credentials. Conventional methods used to identify anomalies cannot be applied due to the resource-constrained and heterogeneous nature of the IoT devices. To address this, a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of these devices needs to be devised. Towards this goal, a smart home scenario is simulated using Smart Cameras and brute-force, and DDoS attacks were launched to capture variations in power profile. Further, we develop machine learning models to detect anomalies based on the power consumption traces. Our proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 94.04% towards detecting the presence of anomalies. Our analysis reveals that power consumption is a promising factor that can be used to detect anomalies in IoT based smart homes.},

The manifestation of HI attack can lead to various types of security issues which includes data theft and denial of service. Traditional HT attack detection techniques are valid for integrated circuit level only, and considered to be very invasive for an IoT device. Therefore, in this paper we propose a non-invasive approach that investigates Hardware Intrinsic Attack Detection in IoT (HIADIoT) devices. This approach detects covert channel and power depletion attacks through the power profile of IoT devices in different modes of operation utilizing machine learning algorithm. The power profile behavior of different IoT devices was observed over a period of time and then preprocessed to serve as data points. These data points is then provided to Random Forest Algorithm which correctly classifies 95.5% of the data point and recognizes potential HI attacks.},

The simple solution of deploying a supervised machine learning algorithm at a centralized location in the network neither scales well nor can identify new devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose and develop a distributed device fingerprinting technique (DEFT), a distributed fingerprinting solution that addresses and exploits the presence of common devices, including new devices, across smart homes and enterprises in a network. A DEFT controller develops and maintains classifiers for fingerprinting, while gateways located closer to the IoT devices at homes perform device classification. Importantly, the controller and gateways coordinate to identify new devices in the network. DEFT is designed to be scalable and dynamic-it can be deployed, orchestrated, and controlled using software-defined networking and network function virtualization. DEFT is able to identify new device types automatically, while achieving high accuracy and low false positive rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DEFT by experimenting on data obtained from real-world IoT devices.},

In addition, the devices can be controlled through text or voice chatting in natural English language. An intelligent agent is developed to give this feature human-like traits. To ensure coordination, the server also implements a graph-based machine learning algorithm to automatically detect user patterns around the house, in order to improve coordination of heterogeneous devices.

To overcome this obstruction, researchers have come up with different intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs). Out of all the implemented technologies, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach. Therefore, to improve the detection accuracy, most ML-based intrusion detection solutions focus only on investigating appropriate ML algorithms. Yet, the limitations in terms of detection accuracy in various attacks are often caused by lack of appropriate detection features. Moreover, the majority of the previous works lack intrusion prevention mechanisms and deployment architectures. Thus, in this research, we study the properties of different smart home security attacks and the quality of the features that can be brought out and employed in ML algorithms to detect each of these attacks efficiently. Furthermore, this research proposes effective intrusion prevention mechanisms and a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based deployment architecture of the IDPSs within home networks.

Major IoT application domains are identified, vulnerabilities are analyzed, and techniques for reducing security risks are suggested in this research. This study uses a mixed-method approach, beginning with a thorough assessment of the literature to identify the most well-known applications for IoT across sectors like industrial, smart cities, healthcare, and smart homes. Current weaknesses related to IoT networks and devices are also examined. Researchers and manufacturers will be able to assess and restrict the vulnerability range on IoT devices with the aid of this study.},
