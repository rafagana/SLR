   abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in computer vision tasks; however, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns regarding their security and reliability. Extensive research has shown that DNNs can be compromised by carefully crafted perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation in both digital and physical domains. Therefore, ensuring the security of DNN-based systems is crucial, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, smart homes/cities, smart industries, video surveillance, and healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the current trends focusing specifically on physical adversarial attacks. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of the concept of physical adversarial attacks, analyzing their key characteristics and distinguishing features. Furthermore, we explore the specific requirements and challenges associated with executing attacks in the physical world. Our article delves into various physical adversarial attack methods, categorized according to their target tasks in different applications, including classification, detection, face recognition, semantic segmentation and depth estimation. We assess the performance of these attack methods in terms of their effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. We examine how each technique strives to ensure the successful manipulation of DNNs while mitigating the risk of detection and withstanding real-world distortions. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and outline potential future research directions in the field of physical adversarial attacks. We highlight the need for enhanced defense mechanisms, the exploration of novel attack strategies, the evaluation of attacks in different application domains, and the establishment of standardized benchmarks and evaluation criteria for physical adversarial attacks. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to gain a holistic understanding of physical adversarial attacks in computer vision and facilitate the development of robust and secure DNN-based systems.  © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), network security has become very important as cyber-attackers can easily compromise such distributed networks and systems. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a basic and essential security mechanism to detect malicious traffic. In the literature, in addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, many deep learning schemes have been examined to enhance the detection performance. However, insufficient amounts of labeled samples are still a challenge for real-world implementation, especially in some scenarios such as smart home and Internet of Vehicles. To address this issue, we explore transfer learning as a promising solution. In this work, we develop TDL-IDS, a transfer deep learning based IDS that can work with limited labeled data items. Our approach first uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model on the source domain and then leverages transfer learning to continue the training process on the target domain. In the evaluation, we use NSL-KDD as the source domain, and AWID as the target domain. Our results indicate that TDL-IDS can outperform many similar approaches. © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {With the advent of the advanced metering infrastructure, electricity usage data is being continuously generated at large volumes by smart meters vastly deployed across the modern power grid. Electric power utility companies and third party entities such as smart home management solution providers gain significant insights into these datasets via machine learning (ML) models. These are then utilized to perform active/passive power demand management that fosters economical and sustainable electricity usage. Although ML models are powerful, these remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A novel stealthy black-box attack construction model is proposed that targets deep learning models utilized to perform non-intrusive load monitoring based on smart meter data. These attacks are practical as there is no assumption of the knowledge of training data, internal parameters, and architecture of the targeted ML model. The profound impact of the proposed stealthy attack constructions on energy analytics and decision-making processes is shown through comprehensive theoretical, practical, and comparative analysis. This work sheds light on vulnerabilities of ML models in the smart grid context and provides valuable insights for securely accommodating increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence in the modern power grid.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks as well as botnet-based attacks are among the most important security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Most of the existing research approaches use centralized defense mechanisms to prevent DDoS attacks in IoT environments. However, it is important to provide a reliable and scalable solution to prevent DDoS attacks. Combining technologies such as distributed blockchain-based mechanisms and smart contracts facilitates the construction of a trusted distributed framework that can defend against DDoS attacks in IoT. In this article, we have proposed a multilevel DDoS mitigation approach (ML-DDoS) to protect IoT devices and other computing resources or machines using the blockchain-based framework. The core concept of the proposed system is to use a device-based verification mechanism using blockchain and exclude malicious devices from IoT environments. The proposed framework was developed using Hyperledger Caliper (a blockchain benchmark tool) and its performance was evaluated using three benchmark applications. Compared to the state of the art, the results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 35&#x0025; improvement in throughput, up to 40&#x0025; improvement in latency, and up to 25&#x0025; better utilization of CPU.

   abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.  © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This work introduces a decision support framework, called Cyber Risk Optimiser for Smart homeS (CROSS), which advises both smart home users and smart home service providers on how to select an optimal portfolio of cyber security controls to counteract cyber attacks in a smart home including traditional cyber attacks and adversarial machine learning attacks. CROSS is based on a multi-objective bi-level two-stage optimisation. In stage-one optimisation, the problem is modelled as a multi-leader-follower game that considers both security and economic objectives, where the provider selects a security portfolio to protect both itself and its users, while rational attackers target the weakest path. Stage-two optimisation is a Stackelberg security game that focuses on additional user security controls under the remit of smart home users. While CROSS can potentially be applied to other similar use cases, in this paper, our aim is to address threats against artificial intelligence (AI) applications as the use of AI in smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new cyber threats to home environments. Specifically, we have implemented and assessed CROSS in a smart heating use case in a prototypical AI-enabled IoT environment that combines characteristics and vulnerabilities currently present on existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, demonstrating the selection of optimal decisions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, managing the immense number of communication devices on the premises of a smart home is a challenging task. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging global trend with billions of smart devices to be connected in the near future resulting in a huge amount of diversified data. The continuous expansion of the IoT network causes complications and vulnerabilities due to its dynamic nature and heterogeneous traffic. In the applications of IoT, the wireless sensor network (WSN) plays a major role, and to take benefits from WSN, medium access control (MAC) is the primary protocol to optimize, which helps in allocating resources to a huge number of devices in the smart home environment. Furthermore, artificial intelligence is highly demanded to enhance the efficiency of existing systems and IoT applications. Therefore, the purpose of this research paper is to achieve an optimized medium access control protocol through machine learning. The machine learning classifier, e.g., random forest (RF) and linear regression model, is adopted for predicting the features of home area networks. The proposed technique is helpful and could overcome the demerits of existing protocols in relation to scalability, throughput, access delay, and reliability and help in achieving an autonomous home area network (HAN). © 2023 by the authors.},

The architecture, on the other hand, may encounter a variety of security and privacy challenges at multiple levels.It is in the applied experimental session testing the performance of various machine learning (ML) models for threat detection that one may get a thorough grasp of where and how Data Science can offer value to IoT network security. The findings serve as a foundation for illustrating the advantages of integrating new technology for the purpose of forecasting risks and concerns. Implementing machine learning into intelligent security systems, in addition, increases the requirement for a multi-disciplinary strategy and data infrastructure to manage the whole lifespan of a security product (Software Engineering end-to-end, including ML and Data DevOps). In this paper, we give an intelligent security algorithm for home data privacy and security in IoT. Experiments using the publicly available IoT-23 dataset, which contains labeled information on malicious and benign IoT network traffic, are used to complete the case study. The benign situations were received directly from the actual hardware and were not faked in any way or form. This enabled real-time network activity to be observed and evaluated. Therefore, models provide accurate outputs that may be used to forecast and identify vulnerabilities on Internet of Things-based systems. Furthermore, the lab might be expanded to accommodate the development of commercial and industry demos to demonstrate the benefits of building intrusion detection systems that use machine learning algorithms. © 2023 University of Bahrain.

The IoT ecosystem suffers from numerous vulnerabilities, due to reasons such as design flows, hardware limitation or simply human error and is subject to various attacks targeting IoT services, platforms and networks. These attacks can have significant consequences such as economic losses, service disruption or data leaks. Cyber-attacks are an unavoidable and must be faced in tandem with the global growth of IoT networks. An approach that can assist in developing robust, intelligent Cyber-security tools for IoT is using Artificial Intelligence. In the following paper, a mechanism is presented that automatically selects appropriate mitigation actions in an optimal way to countermeasure attacks faced by IoT networks. This is achieved by using an novel Artificial Intelligence mechanism based on a Deep Neural Architecture called Pointer Networks to optimize security-related KPIs. Experimental results, show that the proposed method produces equal or better Pareto optimal solutions, performs faster compared to state-of-the-art (SoA) algorithms and scales better. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The technological leap of smart technologies has brought the conventional electrical grid in a new digital era called Smart Grid (SG), providing multiple benefits, such as two-way communication, pervasive control and self-healing. However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home. © 2021},

Smartphones allow homeowners to remotely operate these devices and monitor and manage their homes in real time. Smart home devices use IoT to make life smarter, more effective, and more customized. Smart home IoT devices may be hacked to access security cameras and personal data. Attackers might manipulate smart locks or thermostats, threatening people and their property. These IoT devices are networked, making strong cybersecurity necessary to guard against emerging threats. Early cybersecurity identification enables quick reaction and remediation, limiting damage and averting attack escalation. Early detection of security breaches allows proactive actions to stop unwanted access, limit the effect, and protect critical data. It dramatically minimizes the window of vulnerability, improving cybersecurity resilience and safeguarding systems from protracted exploitation or criminal activity. This research improves smart home security by training Aposemat IoT-23 dataset. XGBoost, Simple Neural Network, GaussianNB and Logistic Regression are evaluated to identify and prevent harmful data injection and illegal access. The results show they protect smart home networks with over 99% accuracy. Smart home IoT device protection is excellent with machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Simple Neural Network.

   abstract = {Smart home automation is an emerging market trend that makes life simpler and easier to control. The term “home automation system” refers to the centralized management of lighting and electrical appliances, as well as the locking of doors and the activation of alarm systems, among other things, to improve the home’s energy efficiency, safety, and comfort. To meet the smart home’s aims of monitoring, protecting, and controlling, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies play a pivotal role by incorporating sensors and actuators that support various network operations and system automation. Consequently, people now have an assistant who manages their home and needs based on commands they provide. The limitations of existing home automation systems include a lack of IoT technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, user-unfriendly interfaces, unauthorized access, short wireless connectivity ranges, cybersecurity issues, and excessive costs. As a result, this research proposes an affordable home automation system that integrates IoT, AI, and blockchain technology. In this regard, a framework is created to enable home monitoring and automated control of appliances via the Internet at any time and from any location. Our proposed work controls household appliances in an easy and effective manner over the internet, as well as identifies home intruders and provides support for autonomous home safety operations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

   abstract = {In today's era, the artificial intelligence of things (AIT) has revolutionized every sphere of human life. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can effectively manage the heterogeneity of IoT devices. The applications of AIT are seen in various verticals, including smart homes/offices, smart factories, Industrial IoT, precision agriculture, etc. In particular, AIT has been a huge asset to the farming sector. Smart farm monitoring requires a huge number of sensors deployed in the monitoring field that measure various physical parameters such as humidity, soil moisture, temperature, etc. However, the main challenge is to handle the vulnerability of sensor node failure due to any natural calamity. This leads to the malfunctioning of sensor modules, which degrades the performance of the network. Also, sensor nodes are battery-limited. It is difficult to recharge and replace the sensors frequently. This article proposes an AI-based hyperparameter-Tuned least square support vector machine (HT-LS-SVM) for fault diagnosis that detects faults with high accuracy. Also, it proposes mobile sink that applies reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to perform obstacle-Aware path planning. This algorithm adds self-learning capability to the mobile sink, which makes the system autonomous and improves network lifetime significantly. The simulation and testbed results depict the outperformance of the proposed scheme in terms of false detection accuracy (FDA), false alarm rate (FAR), false-positive rate (FPR), F1 score, network lifetime, latency, and energy consumption.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Due to memory and processing limitations, IoT devices face security vulnerabilities. Several rule-based detection approaches are vulnerable. Many rule-based detection systems are also attackable. This research proposes a machine learning (ML)-based botnet detection system using network traffic data from five smart home IoT devices under attack. The 'Gafgyt' and 'Mirai' botnet attacks against IoT devices were categorized into five. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) ML algorithms were used to identify attack from benign traffic data in over a million records from individual devices utilizing 115 factors. The best feature analysis was done utilizing the RF method to improve model correctness and processing speed. With 99.99% accuracy, 99.87% precision, 99.79% recall, and 99.89% AUROC rating, RF is superior.

   abstract = {“Industry 5.0” is the latest industrial revolution. A variety of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and others, come together to form it. Billions of devices are connected for high-speed data transfer, especially in a 5G-enabled industrial environment for information collection and processing. Most of the issues, such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices, and protocols used, may not be applicable in the future as these protocols are based upon a centralized mechanism. This centralized mechanism may have a single point of failure along with the computational overhead. Thus, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors, for example, sensors in different regions may collect and process the data for making intelligent decisions. In such an environment, reliability, security, and privacy are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon a centralized control mechanism. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper provides the opportunities for and highlights some of the most impressive initiatives that help to curve the future. This new era will bring about significant changes in the way businesses operate, allowing them to become more cost-effective, more efficient, and produce higher-quality goods and services. As sensors are getting more accurate, cheaper, and have lower time responses, 5G networks are being integrated, and more industrial equipment and machinery are becoming available; hence, various sectors, including the manufacturing sector, are going through a significant period of transition right now. Additionally, the emergence of the cloud enables modern production models that use the cloud (both internal and external services), networks, and systems to leverage the cloud’s low cost, scalability, increased computational power, real-time communication, and data transfer capabilities to create much smarter and more autonomous systems. We discuss the ways in which decentralized networks that make use of protocols help to achieve decentralization and how network meshes can grow to make things more secure, reliable, and cohere with these technologies, which are not going away anytime soon. We emphasize the significance of new design in regard to cybersecurity, data integrity, and storage by using straightforward examples that have the potential to lead to the excellence of distributed systems. This groundbreaking paper delves deep into the world of industrial automation and explores the possibilities to adopt blockchain for developing solutions for smart cities, smart homes, healthcare, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicles, and supply chain management within Industry 5.0. With an in-depth examination of various consensus mechanisms, readers gain a comprehensive understanding of the latest developments in this field. The paper also explores the current issues and challenges associated with blockchain adaptation for industrial automation and provides a thorough comparison of the available consensus, enabling end customers to select the most suitable one based on its unique advantages. Case studies highlight how to enable the adoption of blockchain in Industry 5.0 solutions effectively and efficiently, offering valuable insights into the potential challenges that lie ahead, particularly for smart industrial applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The rise of the internet of things (IoT) popularity with smart home systems and improvements in the technologies of embedded devices raised interest in such solutions. However, with the increase in the utilization of these technologies, the security risks increased as well. Connecting a large number of devices to the same network is risky, because the security of any network is only as strong as its weakest part, and in the case of IoT the weakest link can be a small home appliance. This research aims to improve the means for detecting and preventing attacks on such networks via a hybrid method between machine learning and population-based metaheuristics. The proposed study introduces an enhanced version of the recently emerged sine cosine algorithm (SCA) that was used for tuning extreme learning machine (ELM). The hybrid method was validated against the UNSW-NB15 dataset that consists of features that describe regular (normal) and botnet traffic, where the latter refers to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The hybrid framework’s performance metrics were compared with several other classic machine learning models, as well as with other ELM solutions tuned by other population-based metaheuristics. Based on experimental data, the conclusion that the proposed method on average obtains the best performance can be derived. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) can classify each network’s flow behavior as benign or malicious by detecting heterogeneous features, including both categorical and numerical features. However, the present ML-based NIDSs are deemed insufficient in terms of their ability to generalize, particularly in changing network environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home. Although IoT devices add so much to home comforts, they also introduce potential risks and vulnerabilities. Recently, many NIDS studies on other IoT scenarios, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart cities, focus on utilizing the telemetry data of IoT devices for IoT intrusion detection. Because when IoT devices are under attack, their abnormal telemetry data values can reflect the anomaly state of those devices. Those telemetry data-based IoT NIDS methods detect intrusion events from a different view, focusing on the attack impact, from the traditional network traffic-based NIDS, which focuses on analyzing attack behavior. The telemetry data-based NIDS is more suitable for IoT devices without built-in security mechanisms. Considering the smart home IoT scenario, which has a smaller scope and a limited number of IoT devices compared to other IoT scenarios, both NIDS views can work independently. This motivated us to propose a novel ML-based NIDS to combine the network traffic-based and telemetry data-based NIDS together. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based IoT NIDS method to learn the behaviors and effects of attacks from different types of data that are generated in the heterogeneous IoT environment. The proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual embeddings for input network features. Based on the contextual embeddings, our method can solve the feature set challenge, including both continuous and categorical features. Our method is the first to utilize both network traffic data and IoT sensors’ telemetry data at the same time for intrusion detection. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our method on a realistic network traffic intrusion detection dataset named ToN_IoT, with an accuracy of 97.95% for binary classification and 95.78% for multiple classifications on pure network data. With the extra IoT information, the performance of our method has been improved to 98.39% and 97.06%, respectively. A comparative study with existing works shows that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ToN_IoT dataset. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Identification of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become an essential part of network management to secure the privacy of smart homes and offices. With its wide adoption in the current era, IoT has facilitated the modern age in many ways. However, such proliferation also has associated privacy and data security risks. In the case of smart homes and smart offices, unknown IoT devices increase vulnerabilities and chances of data theft. It is essential to identify the connected devices for secure communication. It is very difficult to maintain the list of rules when the number of connected devices increases and human involvement is necessary to check whether any intruder device has approached the network. Therefore, it is required to automate device identification using machine learning methods. In this article, we propose an accuracy boosting model (ABM) using machine learning models of random forest and extreme gradient boosting. Featuring engineering techniques are employed along with cross-validation to accurately identify IoT devices such as lights, smoke detectors, thermostat, motion sensors, baby monitors, socket, TV, security cameras, and watches. The proposed ensemble model utilizes random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) as base learners with adaptive boosting. The proposed ensemble model is tested with extensive experiments involving the IoT Device Identification dataset from a public repository. Experimental results indicate a higher accuracy of 91%, precision of 93%, recall of 93%, and F1 score of 93%. © 2024 Zeng and Asif},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses a near-incalculable collection of dispersed and embedded computing devices acting as sensors and actuators, generating data at an incredible scale. However, a lack of coherency and cross-compatibility in IoT deployments has lead to increasing redundancy and waste of resources. To combat this, various concepts have been proposed for an open IoT Search Engine (IoT-SE) that serves human and machine users. Invariably, the IoT-SE envisions distributed query retrieval to handle massive volumes of devices and data. Incorporating the massively heterogeneous protocols and properties of devices deployed, the search of such a system for timely and pertinent data is massively challenging, to provide useful knowledge and service for IoT systems. Moreover, enabling and maintaining security and privacy in an IoT-SE is likewise a prodigious task, as end users, IoT devices, and the search system itself, have different protocols and requirements. To this end, a study of security issues in IoT search is conducted to outline the challenges ahead, and a case study to resolve practical security vulnerabilities in an IoT-SE system is carried out. The pertinent issues of security in an IoT-SE system are reviewed. Particularly, (i) a taxonomy is detailed for IoT-SE security issues, (ii) the vulnerabilities of Machine Learning (ML) models in the IoT-SE are considered, and (iii) defensive mechanisms are presented for securing IoT Search. A case study is carried out to implement basic security features in IoT search, addressing the risk of false queries through the design of ML-based solutions. Finally, a road-map for future research is provided, including the security and privacy for IoT systems connected to the IoT-SE, distributed edge computing in IoT-SE, privacy-preserving data markets in IoT-SE, and distributed machine learning in IoT-SE.

When compared to other recent approaches, the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The spamicity score of the home IoT device is calculated using the Spam Score algorithm.

These devices interact with each other as well as with their surrounding environments to sense, gather and process data of various kinds. Such devices are now part of our everyday's life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.  © 2014 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a segmentation based anomaly detection method that converts unsupervised time-series data into a supervised format, and then trains a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to detect anomalies. The LSTM network is trained to predict un-sound statistical properties, which gets combined with sound statistical properties, to detect anomalies in IoT sensor data. Data smoothing using Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing is also performed, without loss of information, to improve anomaly detector performance. Using Precision, Recall, and F-Measure scores as metrics, results show efficient anomaly detection performance on IoT temperature sensor data. We, additionally, test performance by varying specific parameters. Lastly, results also show that performing data smoothing, to a certain extent, can improve anomaly detection performance over data that didn't undergo any smoothing. © 2021 IEEE.},

From the smart home, to the smart office, to the smart restaurant, and even the smart traffic system, this technology has become a crucial aspect of the modern experience. Although these systems are typically quite efficient, the rapid growth of embedded systems in smart cities has created inconsistencies and misalignments between secured and unsecured systems, which has created a need for secure, invulnerable embedded systems to protect modern users from the dangers of hacking. To address this problem, we have developed a large, novel, and unbiased dataset for embedded system vulnerability detection and modifying an advanced machine learning model for Linux Kernel. This unique dataset will provide the landscape of embedded systems with a multitude of ways to predict the vulnerabilities in the Linux Core and to detect all vulnerabilities during the development process. This research paper discusses the collection, filtering, correlation, and statistics associated with the dataset for Linux Embedded system.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Due to the limitation of hardware resources and the various operating systems (OS) of current SH devices, existing security features cannot protect such an environment. Generally, the traffic patterns of an SH IoT device under attack often changes in the Home Area Network (HAN). Therefore, a Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) logically becomes the forefront security solution for the SH. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assist classification machine learning algorithms generate an anomaly-based NIDS detection model, hence, detecting the abnormal SH IoT device network behaviour. Three network-based attacks were used to evaluate our NIDS solution in a simulated SH test-bed environment. The detection model generated by traditional and ensemble classification Mechanical Learning (ML) methods shows outstanding overall performance.

   abstract = {With the origin of smart homes, smart cities, and smart everything, smart phones came up as an area of magnificent growth and development. These devices became a part of daily activities of human life. This impact and growth have made these devices more vulnerable to attacks than other devices such as desktops or laptops. Text messages or SMS (Short Text Messages) are a part of smartphones through which attackers target the users. Smishing (SMS Phishing) is an attack targeting smartphone users through the medium of text messages. Though smishing is a type of phishing, it is different from phishing in many aspects like the amount of information available in the SMS, the strategy of attack, etc. Thus, detection of smishing is a challenge in the context of the minimum amount of information shared by the attacker. In the case of smishing, we have short text messages which are often in short forms or in symbolic forms. A single text message contains very few smishing-related features, and it consists of abbreviations and idioms which makes smishing detection more difficult. Detection of smishing is a challenge not only because of features constraint but also due to the scarcity of real smishing datasets. To differentiate spam messages from smishing messages, we are evaluating the legitimacy of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the message. We have extracted the five most efficient features from the text messages to enable the machine learning classification using a limited number of features. In this paper, we have presented a smishing detection model comprising of two phases, Domain Checking Phase and SMS Classification Phase. We have examined the authenticity of the URL in the SMS which is a crucial part of SMS phishing detection. In our system, Domain Checking Phase scrutinizes the authenticity of the URL. SMS Classification Phase examines the text contents of the messages and extracts some efficient features. Finally, the system classifies the messages using Backpropagation Algorithm and compares results with three traditional classifiers. A prototype of the system has been developed and evaluated using SMS datasets. The results of the evaluation achieved an accuracy of 97.93% which shows the proposed method is very efficient for the detection of smishing messages. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {As the ubiquity of IoT devices in smart homes escalates, so does the vulnerability to cyber threats that exploit weaknesses in device security. Timely and accurate detection of attacks is critical to protect smart home networks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a cornerstone in any layered security defense strategy. However, building such a system is challenging given smart home devices' resource constraints and behaviors' diversity. This paper presents an adaptative IDS based on a device-specific approach and SDN deployment. We categorize devices based on traffic profiles to enable specialized architectural design and dynamically assign the suitable detection model. We demonstrate the IDS efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability by thoroughly benchmarking an ensemble of machine learning models, mainly tree ensemble models and extreme learning machine variants, on the up-to-date IoT CICIoT2023 security dataset. Our IDS multi-component device-aware architecture leverages software-defined networking and virtualized network functions for scalable deployment, with an edge computing design to meet strict latency requirements. The results reveal that our adaptive model selection ensures detection accuracy while maintaining low latency, aligning with the critical requirement of real-time accuracy and adaptability to smart home devices' traffic patterns. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) networks are obstructed by security vulnerabilities that hackers can leverage to operate intrusions in many environments, such as smart homes, smart factories, and smart healthcare systems. To overcome this obstruction, researchers have come up with different intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs). Out of all the implemented technologies, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach. Therefore, to improve the detection accuracy, most ML-based intrusion detection solutions focus only on investigating appropriate ML algorithms. Yet, the limitations in terms of detection accuracy in various attacks are often caused by lack of appropriate detection features. Moreover, the majority of the previous works lack intrusion prevention mechanisms and deployment architectures. Thus, in this research, we study the properties of different smart home security attacks and the quality of the features that can be brought out and employed in ML algorithms to detect each of these attacks efficiently. Furthermore, this research proposes effective intrusion prevention mechanisms and a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based deployment architecture of the IDPSs within home networks. Experimental evaluations of the proposed solution are provided using different feature sets and various ML models. The contributions and advancements discussed in this paper will upgrade future research and engineering works on IDPSs for IoT.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept as a new direction of technological development raises new problems such as valid and timely identification of such devices, security vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious activities, and management of such devices. The communication of IoT devices generates traffic that has specific features and differences with respect to conventional devices. This research seeks to analyze the possibilities of applying such features for classifying devices, regardless of their functionality or purpose. This kind of classification is necessary for a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, such as a smart home where the number and types of devices grow daily. This research uses a total of 41 IoT devices. The logistic regression method enhanced by the concept of supervised machine learning (logitboost) was used for developing a classification model. Multiclass classification model was developed using 13 network traffic features generated by IoT devices. Research has shown that it is possible to classify devices into four previously defined classes with high performances and accuracy (99.79%) based on the traffic flow features of such devices. Model performance measures such as precision, F-measure, True Positive Ratio, False Positive Ratio and Kappa coefficient all show high results (0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0.997–0.999, 0–0.001 and 0.9973, respectively). Such a developed model can have its application as a foundation for monitoring and managing solutions of large and heterogeneous IoT environments such as Industrial IoT, smart home, and similar. © 2021, The Author(s).},

IIoT has a wide range of practical applications, including but not limited to supply chain management, connected cars, smart grids, smart cities, and smart homes. Regrettably, these systems are increasingly becoming the focus of cybercrime attacks. Machine learning is a promising technology for creating and implementing resilient security measures in IIoT networks. A new and innovative approach to detecting cyberattacks in the IIoT is proposed in this document, through the use of a hybrid machine classifier (HMC). The HMC model is a unique amalgamation of different ML models, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), extra trees (ET), gradient boosting (GB), AdaBoost (AB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), ), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RFlinear regression (LR), and classification and regression tree (CART). The DS2OS dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness. Several performance metrics, including recall, precision, accuracy, specificity, F1 score, detection rate, and ROC are used to evaluate the system's performance. The proposed model successfully distinguishes between normal and attack traffic, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.7% and 99.8%, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, its performance metrics were compared to those of other advanced attack detection algorithms. The outcomes demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed other ML and DL-based techniques  © 2023 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The future of smart homes is exciting. The number of smart devices connected to the Internet is supposed to increase from 31 billion in 2020 to 75.4 billion by 2025. These devices are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks because of the inherent connectivity in Smart Home. The attacker can use many techniques to compromise the system or cause damage to it such as ransomware, data and identity theft, DDoS attacks, etc. The preliminary results of the study show that people do not have the necessary level of culture to deal with attacks, also they are not aware of the potential security risks in their Smart Homes. They are not aware of the need for more tools to secure them. In light of this issue, this study propose a novel intrusion detection system for Smart Home environments. The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on two deep learning algorithms CNN and LSTM. To train and test the proposed model this study use a new dataset called TON-IoT specific to IoT environment and contains many records about many recent attacks in this particular network. The main goal of this study is to help the user monitors his Smart Home devices by detecting intrusions using a Deep Learning approach. Then, the proposed system will show to the user the detected intrusions through a dashboard. Upon the detection of an intrusion in a device, a notification will be shown to the user through the dashboard. Besides, the system will recommend some countermeasures to the user to help him harden his Smart Home and reduce some potential risks. The obtained results shows that the study model outperforms many existing models based on Machine learning algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this modern age of technology, the Internet of Things has covered all aspects of life including smart situations, smart homes, and smart spaces. Smart homes have a large number of IoT objects that are working continuously without any interruption. Better security and authentication of these smart devices can provide peaceful environments to live in such spaces. It is important to monitor the activities of smart IoT devices to make them work fault-free. Such devices are small, consume relatively less power and resources, and are easily attackable by attackers. It is crucial to protect the integrity and characteristics of the smart home environment from external attacks. Machine Learning played a vital role in recognizing such malicious activities and attempts. Several Machine Learning approaches are available to detect the normal and abnormal behavior of IoT device traffic. This study proposed a machine learning-based anomaly detection approach for smart homes using different classifiers. Testing and evaluation are performed using the University of New South Wales (UNSW) BoT IoT dataset. Machine learning models based on four classifiers are built using an IoT devices dataset. For the Test dataset, the Weighted Precision, Recall, and F1 score of Random forest, decision tree, and AdaBoost is 1 as compared to ANN which has 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96 respectively Results show that high performance, precision, and robustness can be achieved using the proposed methodology. In this way, smart homes' security and identity of devices can be monitored and anomalies can be detected with high accuracy. Attack categories include binary class, multiclass class, and subclasses. Results show Random Forest algorithm outperforms enough to use this methodology in smart environments.  © 2023 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) as an area of tremendous impact, potential, and growth has emerged with the advent of smart homes, smart cities, and smart everything. In the age of IoT, edge devices have taken on greater importance, driving the need for more intelligence and advanced services at the network edge. Since edge devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, they are easy to compromise, more exposed to attackers, and more vulnerable than standard computing systems such as PCs and servers. While several software-based countermeasures have been proposed, they require high computing power and resources that edge devices do not possess. Moreover, modern threats have become more complex and severe, requiring a level of security that can only be provided at the hardware level. In this paper, we realize an efficient hardware-assisted attack detection mechanism for edge devices through effective High Level Synthesize (HLS) optimization techniques. To this end, we propose OptiEdge, a machine learning-guided hardware-assisted resource and timing estimation tool that can effectively reduce the design space exploration for edge devices' design. This is achieved by analyzing suitability of different machine learning algorithms used for detection and how they affect hardware implementation overheads. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy, performance, and hardware efficiency of different ML algorithms, our work can assist researchers investigating this field of cybersecurity. © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) on a global scale has facilitated the convergence of revolutionary technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing. The integration of these technologies has paved the way for the development of intricate infrastructures, such as smart homes, smart cities, and smart industries, that are capable of delivering advanced solutions and enhancing human living standards. Nevertheless, IoT devices, while providing effective connectivity and convenience, often rely on traditional network interfaces that can be vulnerable to exploitation by adversaries. If not properly secured and updated, these legacy communication protocols and interfaces can expose potential vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or compromise sensitive data. To overcome the security challenges associated with smart home systems, we have devised a robust framework that leverages the capabilities of both AI and blockchain technology. The proposed framework employs a standard dataset for smart home systems, from which we first eliminated the anomalies using an isolation forest (IF) algorithm using random partitioning, path length, anomaly score calculation, and thresholding stages. Next, the dataset is utilized for training classification algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to classify the attack and non-attack data of the smart home system. Further, an interplanetary file system (IPFS) is utilized to store classified data (non-attack data) from classification algorithms to confront data-manipulation attacks. The IPFS acts as an onsite storage system, securely storing non-attack data, and its computed hash is forwarded to the blockchain’s immutable ledger. We evaluated the proposed framework with different performance parameters. These include training accuracy (99.53%) by the KNN classification algorithm and 99.27% by IF for anomaly detection. Further, we used the validation curve, lift curve, execution cost of blockchain transactions, and scalability (86.23%) to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The advanced metering infrastructure in modern networked smart homes brings various advantages, such as multiple pricing and energy scheduling. However, smart homes are vulnerable to many cyberattacks, and the most striking one is energy theft. Researchers have developed many countermeasures, fostered by advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Nevertheless, recent advances are not robust enough in practice, partially due to the vulnerabilities of employed ML algorithms. Given a group of smart homes, in this article, we present a covert electricity theft strategy through mimicking normal consumption patterns and compromising neighboring meters concurrently. Such attack is almost impossible to be detected by existing solutions as the manipulated data have little deviation against honest usage records. To address this threat, we initially identify and define two levels of consumption deviations: home-level and interpersonal-level, respectively. Then, we design a feature extraction scheme that can capture the correlation between attacks and honest customers. Finally, we develop a new deep learning-based detection model. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that the presented attack could evade existing mainstream detectors but still gain high profits. In addition, the proposed countermeasure outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has made significant strides in energy management systems recently. Due to the continually increasing cost of energy, supply–demand disparities, and rising carbon footprints, the need for smart homes for monitoring, managing, and conserving energy has increased. In IoT-based systems, device data are delivered to the network edge before being stored in the fog or cloud for further transactions. This raises worries about the data’s security, privacy, and veracity. It is vital to monitor who accesses and updates this information to protect IoT end-users linked to IoT devices. Smart meters are installed in smart homes and are susceptible to numerous cyber attacks. Access to IoT devices and related data must be secured to prevent misuse and protect IoT users’ privacy. The purpose of this research was to design a blockchain-based edge computing method for securing the smart home system, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, in order to construct a secure smart home system with energy usage prediction and user profiling. The research proposes a blockchain-based smart home system that can continuously monitor IoT-enabled smart home appliances such as smart microwaves, dishwashers, furnaces, and refrigerators, among others. An approach based on machine learning was utilized to train the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for energy usage prediction, which is provided in the user’s wallet, to estimate energy consumption and maintain user profiles. The model was tested using the moving average statistical model, the ARIMA model, and the deep-learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model on a dataset of smart-home-based energy usage under changing weather conditions. The findings of the analysis reveal that the LSTM model accurately forecasts the energy usage of smart homes. © 2023 by the authors.},

Smart grids, smart homes, supply chain management, connected cars, and smart cities are the different applications of IIoT. But this system is widely targeted by cyber-criminals. Big data analytics and Deep learning (DL) have considerable potential in developing and designing strong security systems for IIoT networks. This manuscript introduces Multimodal Sensor Data Fusion based Cyberattack Detection with glow worm swarm optimization (MSDF-CDGSO) technique in IIoT environment. The MSDF-CDGSO technique examines the IIoT data for identifying the existence of cyberattacks in the IIoT environment. In the presented MSDF-CDGSO technique, the IIoT devices collect data from different devices and fused them together. At the preliminary stage, the MSDF-CDGSO technique preprocesses the input data to scale them properly. For cyberattack detection, the MSDF-CDGSO technique uses class-specific cost regulation extreme learning machine (CCR-ELM) model. Finally, the GSO method is exploited to adjust the parameter values of the CCR-ELM algorithm. The simulation result analysis of the MSDF-CDGSO method is investigated on benchmark database. A widespread comparison results highlighted that the MSDF-CDGSO technique reaches improved cybersecurity in the IIoT environment.  © 2023 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) allow flexible and efficient automated detection of cyberattacks in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, this has also created an additional attack vector; the machine learning models which support the IDS's decisions may also be subject to cyberattacks known as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In the context of IoT, AML can be used to manipulate data and network traffic that traverse through such devices. These perturbations increase the confusion in the decision boundaries of the machine learning classifier, where malicious network packets are often miss-classified as being benign. Consequently, such errors are bypassed by machine learning based detectors, which increases the potential of significantly delaying attack detection and further consequences such as personal information leakage, damaged hardware, and financial loss. Given the impact that these attacks may have, this paper proposes a rule-based approach towards generating AML attack samples and explores how they can be used to target a range of supervised machine learning classifiers used for detecting Denial of Service attacks in an IoT smart home network. The analysis explores which DoS packet features to perturb and how such adversarial samples can support increasing the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. The results demonstrated that the performance of all the top performing classifiers were affected, decreasing a maximum of 47.2 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks. © 2021},

As the IoT devices communicate continuously leads to concerns about privacy and security due to vulnerabilities which the attackers can exploit. The raw observations of sensor nodes influence the decision-making in IoT networks. So, it requires an established method to monitor and analyze the data from the sensor nodes. Therefore, data collected nodes in IoT systems must resist attacks through anomaly detection implemented on the data collected sensor nodes. This paper proposed the CatBoosting approach to perform intelligent and adaptive anomaly detection for smart home environment devices. The proposed approach assists in supervising the data with normal and abnormal activities with enhanced resources management.

However, such applications may be susceptible to attacks by adversarial examples. In this paper, we develop a white-box adversarial attack mechanism to generate adversarial examples for data obtained from smart-meters installed in residential houses, and demonstrate that their statistical properties are indistinguishable from those of the true datapoints. The attack mechanism focuses specifically on Deep Learning based models used to perform appliance classification in smart home environments. The statistical indistinguishability of the adversarial datapoints from the true datapoints indicates that non Machine Learning based solutions may not be able to tackle the challenge posed by adversarial examples. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated using the publicly available United Kingdom-Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity smart-meter dataset. © 2021 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Electric power systems courses have been traditionally offered by electrical engineering technology programs for a long time, with the main objective to introduce students to the fundamental concepts in the field of electric power systems and electrical to mechanical energy conversion. A typical electric power systems course covers a variety of topics, such as general aspects of electric power system design, electric generators, components of transmission and distribution systems, power flow analysis, system operation, and performance measures. In the last decades, electric power systems have significantly modernized alongside with requirement of improvement in system efficiency, reliability, cybersecurity, and environmental sustainability. The current modernized grid is called “Smart Grid,” which integrates advanced sensing technologies, control methods using machine learning approaches, and integrated communications into current electric power systems. Consequently, offered electric power systems courses are required to update in electrical engineering technology as well, to meet the industry needs of a workforce prepared to integrate smart grid technologies, such as advanced sensing, control, monitoring, communication, renewable energy, storage, computing, cybersecurity, etc. However, such updates of the course content are not always easy to implement due to the complexity of smart grid technologies and the limited number of instructors having knowledge of those technologies. In addition, smart grid courses should include a hands-on component aligned with the theoretical upgrades introduced in the course in the form of term projects. Such projects can be on a variety of topics, such as smart home/building, smart meter, smart distribution system, microgrid, communication infrastructure, Distributed energy resources (DERs) (e.g., rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), wind), electric vehicle (EV), customer engagement, energy generation forecasting, load forecasting, and others. This paper will discuss the details of introducing a new course on smart grids in an electrical engineering technology program, including detailed examples of project selection. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

   abstract = {Secure and private communications using the Internet of Things (IoT) pose several challenges for smart home systems. In particular, data collected from IoT devices comprise sensitive personal information such as biomedical data, financial data, and location and activity data. Recent research looks into the use of blockchain in smart home systems, protecting the privacy of the data in use. Such solutions need to address the issue of privacy using a formal and mathematical model for data privacy due to the vulnerability associated with privacy-preserving blockchain networks. In the present paper, our approach aims to provide a privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanism in the context of Smart Homes that agree to contribute their data to a cloud server using machine learning to improve services for home users. We propose the use of differential privacy, a powerful concept in privacy preserving schemes to provide formal assurances about how much information is leaked using a privacy budget. The main purpose of using such a privacy-preserving scheme is to limit what can be inferred about individual training data from the model. Our techniques use a R′enyi differential privacy (RDP) machine learning scheme and are based on a variant of the stochastic gradient descent function. The performance of our proposed framework is evaluated using three public datasets: UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and ToN-IoT datasets. Our findings show that differential private models can provide privacy protection against attackers by sacrificing a substantial amount of model utility. Therefore, we propose an empirical value of ϵ, that can optimally balances utility and privacy for the current smart home scenario datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories, or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Anomaly detection in smart homes is paramount in the prevailing information age as smart devices remain susceptible to sophisticated cyber-attacks. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and insecure, unencrypted data transfer to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Sensible deployment of conventional security measures is jeopardized by the heterogeneity and resource constraints of smart devices. This article presents a novel approach that leverages the power consumption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to detect anomalous behavior in smart home environments. We prototype a smart camera using Raspberry Pi and gather power traces for normal activity. Furthermore, we model DDoS attacks on the experimental setup and generate attack traces of power consumption. Besides, we compare the performances of several machine learning models for accurate prediction of the presence of anomalies. A deep feed-forward neural network model achieves an accuracy of 99.2% compared to other models. Empirical evaluations of the proposed concept affirm that power consumption is a promising parameter in detecting anomalies in smart homes. The proposed method is suitable for smart homes as it does not impose additional overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {This article proposes a general purpose IoT framework usually applicable to all Edge-to-Cloud applications and provides an evaluation study on a use-case involving automotive V2X architecture, tested and verified on a toy smart-car in an emulated smart-car environment. The architecture in study is finely tuned to mimic actual scenarios and therefore the sensors available on the toy car encompasses almost all the sensors that assist a regular ADAS in smart cars of today. The cloud connectivity is maintained through the CoAP protocol which is a standard IoT connectivity protocol. Finally, the security solution proposed is that of a smart Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is built using Machine Learning (ML) technique and is deployed on the edge. The edge IDS is capable of performing anomaly detection and reporting both detection results as well as sensor collected big data to the cloud. On the cloud side the server stores and maintains the collected data for further retraining of ML models for edge anomaly detection which is differentiated into two categories viz. sensor anomaly detection model and network anomaly detection model. To demonstrate Software update Over The Air (SW-OTA) the cloud in the evaluation setup implements a ML model upgrade capability from the cloud to the connected edge. This implementation and evaluation provides a Proof-of-Concept of the choice of ML as IDS candidate and the framework in general to be applicable to various other IoT scenarios such as Healthcare, Smart-home, Smart-city, Harbour and Industrial environments, and so on, and paves way for future optimization studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this article, we present a novel adversarial machine learning algorithm powered by black-box optimization to synthesize stealthy dynamic load-altering attacks aiming at evading existing intrusion detection measures while maximizing the damage inflicted on the grid. The proposed algorithm is applied on a case study involving peak shaving using direct load control of residential electric water heaters. It is capable of designing stealthy attacks that can increase the detectors' misclassification probability by up to 44%. It can also be adapted to other load-altering attacks involving different DSM programs or other classes of loads.

   abstract = {Modern smart home control systems utilize realtime occupancy and activity monitoring to ensure control efficiency, occupants' comfort, and optimal energy consumption. Moreover, adopting machine learning-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) enhances security and reliability. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although ADMs limit attack scopes, the availability of information like occupants' location, conducted activities, and alteration capability of smart appliances increase the attack surface. Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems is crucial to design robust defense solutions. However, state-of-the-art analyzers do not consider contemporary control and defense solutions and generate trivial attack vectors. To address this, we propose a control and defense-aware novel attack analysis framework for a modern smart home control system, efficiently extracting ADM rules. We verify and validate our framework using a state-of-the-art dataset and a prototype testbed. © 2023 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Smart cities, businesses, workplaces, and even residences have all been converged by the Internet of Things (IoT). The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results. The presented model can be used for the real-time security of smart home cyber-physical systems and develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0. © 2023 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {Restrictive public health measures such as isolation and quarantine have been used to reduce the pandemic virus's transmission. With no proper treatment, older adults have been specifically advised to stay home, given their vulnerability to COVID-19. This pandemic has created an increasing need for new and innovative assistive technologies capable of easing the lives of people with special needs. Smart home systems have become widely popular in providing such assistive services to isolated older adults. These systems can provide better services to assist older people if it anticipates what activities inhabitants will perform ahead of time. For example, a smart home can prompt inhabitants to initiate essential activities like taking medicine using activity prediction. This paper proposes a multi-task activity prediction system that jointly predicts labels, locations, and starting times of future activities. The observed sequence of previous activities characterizes future activities. We use body activity information from wearable sensors and motion information from passive environmental sensors to sense activities of daily living of older adults. The activity prediction system consists of recurrent neural networks to capture temporal dependencies. This work also carries out several experiments on collected and existing real datasets to evaluate the system's performance.  © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an enabler paradigm for different applications, such as healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and recently, enterprise systems. Significant advances in IoT networks have been hindered by security vulnerabilities and threats, which, if not addressed, can negatively impact the deployment and operation of IoT-enabled systems. This article addresses IoT security and presents an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 μs. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 μs. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature. Thus, it is an accurate and lightweight tool for detecting intrusions in IoT systems.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes has raised significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods for anomaly detection often require sharing sensitive IoT data with a central server, posing security and efficiency challenges. In response, this paper introduces FedGroup, a novel Federated Learning (FL) method inspired by FedAvg. FedGroup revolutionizes the central model’s learning process by updating it based on the learning patterns of distinct groups of IoT devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedGroup consistently achieves comparable or superior accuracy in anomaly detection when compared to both federated and non-federated learning methods. Additionally, Ensemble Learning (EL) collects intelligence from numerous contributing models, leading to enhanced prediction performance. Furthermore, FedGroup significantly improves the detection of attack types and their details, contributing to a more robust security framework for smart homes. Our approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.64% with a minimal false positive rate (FPR) of 0.02% in attack type detection, and an impressive 99.89% accuracy in attack type detail detection. © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Concurrent advancements in machine learning (ML) and Internet of Things have allowed several interesting interdisciplinary applications, such as classification tasks based on data generated by smart devices for applications, such as security, resource allocation, activity and task classification. However, these applications can be vulnerable to attacks by adversarial examples. The first contribution of this article is the development of a white-box adversarial attack mechanism to generate adversarial examples for data obtained from smart meters installed in residential houses. For the second contribution, we present an analysis to demonstrate that the statistical properties of adversarial datapoints are indistinguishable from those of the true datapoints. The attack is developed specifically for deep-learning-based models used to perform appliance classification in smart home environments. The statistical indistinguishability of the adversarial datapoints from the true datapoints indicates that non ML-based solutions may not be able to tackle the challenge posed by adversarial examples. As the final contribution, we evaluate the effectiveness of defence mechanisms for white-box adversarial attacks on the proposed attack mechanism, and show that while they can reduce the potency of the attack, the original models still remain significantly affected by the adversarial attack. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: 1) United Kingdom-domestic appliance-level electricity smart meter data set and 2) the Personalized Retrofit Decision Support Tools For U.K. Homes Using Smart Home Technology data set.  © 2014 IEEE.},

As a consequence, preserving the data privacy and security of these applications is of utmost importance. In this respect, a modelling technique for identifying potential data privacy threats and specifying countermeasures to mitigate the related vulnerabilities in such AI-based systems plays a significant role in preserving and securing personal data. Various threat modelling techniques have been proposed such as STRIDE, LINDDUN, and PASTA but none of them is sufficient to model the data privacy threats in autonomous systems. Furthermore, they are not designed to model compliance with data protection legislation like the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is fundamental to protecting data owners' privacy as well as to preventing personal data from potential privacy-related attacks. In this article, we survey the existing threat modelling techniques for data privacy threats in autonomous systems and then analyse such techniques from the viewpoint of GDPR compliance. Following the analysis, We employ STRIDE and LINDDUN in autonomous cars, a specific use-case of autonomous systems, to scrutinise the challenges and gaps of the existing techniques when modelling data privacy threats. Prospective research directions for refining data privacy threats & GDPR-compliance modelling techniques for autonomous systems are also presented.  © 2015 IEEE.},

However, it also provides a sequence of novel cyber-security issues. Although IoT networks provide several advantages, the heterogeneous nature of the network and the wide connectivity of the devices make the network easy for cyber-attackers. Cyberattacks result in financial loss and data breaches for organizations and individuals. So, it becomes crucial to secure the IoT environment from such cyberattacks. With this motivation, the current study introduces an effectual Enhanced Crow Search Algorithm with Deep Learning-Driven Cyberattack Detection (ECSADL-CAD) model for the Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT environment. The presented ECSADL-CAD approach aims to identify and classify the cyberattacks in the SDN-enabled IoT envi-ronment. To attain this, the ECSADL-CAD model initially pre-processes the data. In the presented ECSADL-CAD model, the Reinforced Deep Belief Network (RDBN) model is employed for attack detection. At last, the ECSA-based hyperparameter tuning process gets executed to boost the overall classification outcomes. A series of simulations were conducted to validate the improved outcomes of the proposed ECSADL-CAD model. The experimental outcomes confirmed the superiority of the proposed ECSADL-CAD model over other existing methodologies. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

However, despite the technological advancements that the IoT brings, various new security risks have also been introduced due to the development of new types of attacks. This prevents current intelligent IoT applications from adaptively learning from other intelligent IoT applications, which leaves them in a volatile state. In this paper, we conducted a structured literature review (SLR) on Smart Home's IoT attack detection using machine learning and deep learning. Four journal databases were used to perform this review: IEEE, Science Direct, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and SpringerLink. Sixty articles were selected and studied, where we noted the various patterns and techniques present in the framework of the selected research. We also took note of the different machine learning and deep learning methods, the types of attacks, and the Network layers present in Smart Home. By conducting an SLR, we analyzed the numerous techniques of IoT attack detection for smart homes proposed by various theoretical studies. We enhanced the studied literature by proposing a new solution for better IoT attack detection in smart homes. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The involvement of the Internet of things (IoT) in the development of technology makes systems automated and peoples’ lives easier. The IoT is taking part in many applications, from smart homes to smart industries, in order to make a city smart. One of the major applications of the IoT is the Internet of medical things (IoMT) which deals with patients’ sensitive information. This confidential information needs to be properly transferred and securely authenticated. For successful data protection and preserving privacy, this paper proposes multidevice authentication for the in-hospital segment using a physical unclonable function (PUF) and machine learning (ML). The proposed method authenticates multiple devices using a single message. Most of the protocols require PUF keys to be stored at the server, which is not required in the proposed framework. Moreover, authentication, as well as data, is sent to the server in the same message, which results in faster processing. Furthermore, a single ML model authenticates a group of devices at the same time. The proposed method shows 99.54% accuracy in identifying the group of devices. Moreover, the proposed method takes 2.6 ms and 104 bytes to complete the authentication of a device and takes less time with the increment of devices in the group. The proposed algorithm is analyzed using a formal analysis to show its resistance against various vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {With the ever-increasing cost of livelihood, technological intervention is necessary to keep costs under control. Hence, smart home technology can be considered as a well-established and entrenched region of interest. In the current scenario, research subsidizes present-time houses, enabling the user to design and manage a smart home to conserve energy while allowing for more autonomous applications. A voice-activated home automation system integrates the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Natural Language Processing to deliver a cost-effective and efficient method of interacting with household equipment. The primary objective of this paper is to assess SPAs using blockchain technology and a natural language processor (NLP), as well as the design of a SPA based on the internet of things. Applicable cyber threats and countermeasures are also addressed in this article. Using Yule's coefficient of association, a case study was undertaken to evaluate the association between privacy and security threats posed by this modern technology. The findings show that privacy and security are positively related.  © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Many researchers have studied non-expert users’ perspectives of cyber security and privacy aspects of computing devices at home, but their studies are mostly small-scale empirical studies based on online surveys and interviews and limited to one or a few specific types of devices, such as smart speakers. This paper reports our work on an online social media analysis of a large-scale Twitter dataset, covering cyber security and privacy aspects of many different types of computing devices discussed by non-expert users in the real world. We developed two new machine learning based classifiers to automatically create the Twitter dataset with 435,207 tweets posted by 337,604 non-expert users in January and February of 2019, 2020 and 2021. We analyzed the dataset using both quantitative (topic modeling and sentiment analysis) and qualitative analysis methods, leading to various previously unknown findings. For instance, we observed a sharp (more than doubled) increase of non-expert users’ tweets on cyber security and privacy during the pandemic in 2021, compare to in the pre-COVID years (2019 and 2020). Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, help-seeking, and roles of different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics in all the three years. Our results indicate the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users’ perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on their perspectives. © 2022},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) usage is steadily becoming a way of life. IoT devices can be found in smart homes, factories, farming, etc. However, skyrocketing of IoT devices comes along with many security concerns due to their small and constrained build-up. For instance, a comprised IoT device in a network presents a vulnerability that can be exploited to attack the entire network. Since IoT devices are usually scattered over vast areas, Mobile Network Operators resort to analyzing the traffic generated by these devices to detect the identity (fingerprint) and nature of these devices (legitimate, faulty, or malicious). We propose an efficient solution to fingerprint IoT devices using known classifiers, alongside dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA and Autoencoder. The latter techniques extract the most relevant features required for accurate fingerprinting while reducing the amount of IoT data to process. To assess the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted several experiments on a real-world dataset from an IoT network. The results show that the Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction with a Decision Tree Algorithm reduces the number of features from 14 to 5 while keeping the prediction of the IoT devices fingerprints very high (97%). © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

   abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to the rising popularity of Smart Home Automation (SHAuto). SHAuto uses a variety of interconnected smart devices to provide life-enhancing services such as smart energy control, smart entertainment, smart healthcare, and so on. If these devices are compromised, sensitive data may be disclosed and the compromised devices or other connected devices may be maliciously controlled, threatening the privacy and safety of home occupants. Therefore, controlling access to devices in SHAuto is of paramount importance. However, due to the characteristics of the SHAuto environment, this has become a challenging issue. As a first step towards addressing this challenging issue, this paper provides a comprehensive problem analysis of SHAuto. The problem analysis consists of two parts. The first part is an in-depth analysis of various SHAuto use case scenarios covering three aspects, i.e., device control modes, automation modes, and device communications. This analysis has led to the formulation of a generic model for SHAuto. Based on this model, the second part analyses potential vulnerabilities and threats in relation to authorisation. The comprehensive problem analysis has led to a hypothesis that access to the devices can be controlled by governing device communications and the specification of a set of requirements for the design of secure and usable communication-based access control solutions for SHAuto environments.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Most of the emerging smart devices have relatively simple architectures, and security vulnerabilities may exist in the perception layer, transport layer, and application layer. At present, most of the security analysis frameworks for IoT devices require additional high-performance devices. At the same time, the emerging 'mining' malware and other attack methods that directly plunder the computing resources of the device have not received attention. In response to the above problems, this paper designs and implements a smart home security analysis system.

   abstract = {Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) manufacturers seek customer feedback to enhance their products and services, creating a smart ecosystem, like a smart home. Due to security and privacy concerns, blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) ecosystems can let CIoT manufacturers update their machine learning (ML) models using end-user data. Federated learning (FL) uses privacy-preserving ML techniques to forecast customers’ needs and consumption habits, and blockchain replaces the centralized aggregator to safeguard the ecosystem. However, blockchain technology (BCT) struggles with scalability and quick ledger expansion. In BCFL, local model generation and secure aggregation are other issues. This research introduces a novel architecture, emphasizing gateway peer (GWP) in the blockchain network to address scalability, ledger optimization, and secure model transmission issues. In the architecture, we replace the centralized aggregator with the blockchain network, while GWP limits the number of local transactions to execute in BCN. Considering the security and privacy of FL processes, we incorporated differential privacy and advanced normalization techniques into ML processes. These approaches enhance the cybersecurity of end-users and promote the adoption of technological innovation standards by service providers. The proposed approach has undergone extensive testing using the well-respected Stanford (CARS) dataset. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed architecture enhances network scalability and significantly optimizes the ledger. In addition, the normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under DP protection. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, this integration of diverse smart devices has brought significant cybersecurity challenges. Detecting and analyzing abnormal network packets have become paramount, signifying potential intrusions, malicious activities, or system errors and ensuring the security and stability of smart home systems. Machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forests, have shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, most research has concentrated on anomaly detection rather than malicious activity in smart homes. The vast datasets collected from various scenarios pose methodological and algorithmic challenges for applying machine learning techniques. To fill these research gaps, our study introduces traditional machine-learning methods for detecting abnormal network packets in smart homes using the IoT-23 dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features, and training various machine learning models. The correlation matrix helps validate the feature selection of the best models based on performance metrics like precision, F1-score, recall, accuracy ratio, training score, and training time cost. Additionally, the study classifies 12 types of malicious malware across different machine learning models, considering performance within the context of smart home devices. This study implements real-time anomaly detection on the Raspberry Pi using packet captures and Zeek flowmeter methods. The findings contribute insights into models suitable for smart home security. In addition, our research enhances the understanding and application of machine learning methods for bolstering security in smart homes.  © 2023 ACM.},

The rapid development of IoT and its increasing demand in different fields of life create a serious problem of security for the IoT environment, which needs serious consideration to protect the IoT-enabled systems from external networks and cyber-attacks. Because of the open deployment environment and constrained resources, the IoT is prone to malicious assaults. Furthermore, the IoT’s diverse and dispersed properties make it difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to keep up with current technological developments. An ML-enabled IoT-based IDS is one of the most important security methods that can assist in defending computer networks and the IoT environment from numerous attacks and malicious activities. Keeping in mind the significant contribution of ML to securing the IoT environment, we proposed an ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT networks and applications in this study. In the proposed system, we proposed a modified Random Forest (RF) algorithm and compared its performance with nine well-known ML algorithms for the detection of network attacks. Further, two of the most recent and well-known network datasets, i.e., TON-IoT and UNSW-NB15, are used to check the effectiveness of the ML-enabled IDS. The performance of the utilized ML algorithms was measured with the help of different performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, etc. The experimental outcomes illustrate the importance of the proposed ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT environment and applications. The proposed system applies to almost all of the resource-constrained devices that use the IoT network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Contemporary home control systems determine real-time heating/cooling demands utilizing smart sensor devices, giving rise to demand control heating, ventilation, and cooling (DCHVAC) systems, thus improving the home's energy efficiency. The adoption of activity monitoring in the smart home control system further augments the controller efficiency and improves occupants' comfort and productivity, elderly monitoring, and so forth. Additionally, the learned occupants' activity patterns help embed machine learning (ML)-based abnormality detection capability to track inconsistencies among the zone sensor measurements. Hence, the incorporation of an activity monitoring system assists anomaly detection models (ADMs) in detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks that are being glowingly researched due to their massive damage capability. However, in this work, we propose a novel attack strategy that identified that the knowledge of occupants' activities along with indoor air quality (IAQ) and occupancy sensor measurements allows the attackers to launch even more hazardous attack (i.e., significant increment in energy cost/ worsening health conditions for the occupants). Hence, it is crucial to analyze the security of the activity monitoring-based smart home DCHVAC system. Accordingly, we propose a novel formal threat analyzer that analyzes the threat space of the smart home DCHVAC control system, which is modeled by rule-based control policies and ML-based ADMs. The rules from the ADM are extracted through an efficient algorithm. The constraints associated with the rules are solved through a satisfiability module theorem (SMT)-based solver. %We performed our initial evaluation of the proposed threat analyzer's effectiveness on the Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS) dataset using some metrics. We will further experiment with other metrics along experimenting with our collaborator's dataset (KTH live-in lab) and open-source Örebro datasets for assessing the framework with realistic occupants' activity. Moreover, we also created our prototype testbed for evaluating the feasibility of the proposed attack and threat analyzer. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

Intruders can recognize through the understanding of the exchanged data, their locations, or knowing their associated services. Such information might make the home resident vulnerable to life attacks. Therefore, protecting sensors identities in smart home systems is of high interest in this domain. This paper introduces a novel technique that protects sensors’ identity from being recognized through cordless communication environments. Our proposed approach utilizes a three-phase technique that controls a synchronized queue among connected sensors and keeps their identity hidden from outsiders. The proposed approach preserves the linearity of time that is required to manage the protection of the home network. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on four different smart homes datasets. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to measure how our proposed approach is affected by different environmental variables. The results indicated that the proposed approach provides a significant performance in protecting sensors identities in smart home area networks. Furthermore, during the sensitivity analysis, we found that our proposed technique’s performance is highly affected by the threshold value that defines each sensor’s time interval. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are common in today’s computer networks. These devices can be computationally powerful, yet prone to cybersecurity exploitation. To remedy these growing security weaknesses, this work proposes a new artificial intelligence method that makes these IoT networks safer through the use of autonomous, swarm-based cybersecurity penetration testing. In this work, the introduced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) penetration testing technique is compared against traditional linear and queue-based approaches to find vulnerabilities in smart homes and IoT networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the PSO approach, a network simulator is used to simulate smart home networks of two scales: a small, home network and a large, commercial-sized network. These experiments demonstrate that the swarm-based algorithms detect vulnerabilities significantly faster than the linear algorithms. The presented findings support the case that autonomous and swarm-based penetration testing in a network could be used to render more secure IoT networks in the future. This approach can affect private households with smart home networks, settings within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and military environments. © 2023 by the authors.},

Hence, IoT traffic will count for a major part of Internet traffic; however, its impact on the network is still widely unknown. IoT devices are prone to cyberattacks because of constrained resources or misconfigurations. It is essential to characterize IoT traffic and identify each device to monitor the IoT network and discriminate among legitimate and anomalous IoT traffic. In this study, we deployed a smart-home testbed comprising several IoT devices to study IoT traffic. We performed extensive measurement experiments using a novel IoT traffic generator tool called IoTTGen. This tool can generate traffic from multiple devices, emulating large-scale scenarios with different devices under different network conditions. We analyzed the IoT traffic properties by computing the entropy value of traffic parameters and visually observing the traffic on behavior shape graphs. We propose a new method for identifying traffic entropy-based devices, computing the entropy values of traffic features. The method relies on machine learning to classify the traffic. The proposed method succeeded in identifying devices with a performance accuracy up to 94% and is robust with unpredictable network behavior with traffic anomalies spreading in the network. © 2021 by the authors.},

Using SDN and virtualization, the IoT's size and adaptability can be managed at a lower cost than ever before. Using these intelligent security solutions, we can achieve real-time detection and automation for attack detection and prevention using artificial intelligence.

It is essential owing to the increasing interconnectivity of devices, ranging from smart home appliances to industrial sensors. The potential attack surface expands, necessitating strong cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data, ensure privacy, and prevent disruptions to critical services with these increasing number of IoT devices. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches, hold the potential to mitigate and identify cyberattacks on IoT networks. DL demonstrates promise for effectively preventing and detecting security threats within IoT devices. Despite the importance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in maintaining confidentiality by detecting suspicious activities, classical IDS solutions might face difficulties in the IoT platform. Therefore, this study presents an Artificial Orca Algorithm with Ensemble Learning cyberattack detection and classification (AOAEL-CDC) methodology in an environment of IoT. The presented AOAEL-CDC technique exploited the feature selection (FS) approach with an ensemble learning approach for cyberattack recognition and identification in the IoT atmosphere. In the developed AOAEL-CDC model, the feature selection takes place using the AOA technique. For the cyberattack detection process, the ensemble learning process is carried out by the use of three models such as bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Finally, the hyperparameter range of the DL techniques takes place using the marine predator&#x2019;s algorithm (MPA). To examine the performance analysis of the AOAEL-CDC methodology, a series of simulations take place using a benchmark dataset. An extensive comparative study reported that the BCODL-SDSC technique reaches an effective performance with other models with a maximum accuracy of 99.31%. Authors},

The social setting is very important for this. Communication networks provide uninterrupted internet connectivity for both fixed and mobile devices like PCs and smartphones. Customers may now keep up their level of engagement while interacting with one or more apps at any time and from any location, thanks to developments in information and communication technologies. Many kinds of smart devices might potentially coordinate their responses to events, sending out alerts or keeping records of the system's condition in line with a predetermined policy. Constant progress toward intelligent solutions is improving many facets of modern life, including manufacturing, transportation, electronic healthcare, electronic education, and many more. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the IoT is autonomous and dynamic. Diverse approaches are being developed to address the challenges posed by disparate data sources, fluctuating signal quality, and overwhelming quantities of data. From the perspectives of intelligent system technologies, security, vulnerabilities, and the potential role that intelligent solutions based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) may play, this article examines the IoT. Concerns about privacy and safety have arisen as a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose that the Standard Security Framework (SSF) be made mandatory for all distributed networks to ensure that hardware and software modules may communicate with one another regardless of their respective platforms. In addition, the effectiveness and security of new innovations in using fog and edge computing in conjunction with cloud applications have been studied. . © 2023 IEEE.},

   abstract = {More than 5.1 billion Bluetooth-enabled devices were shipped in the year 2022 and this trend is expected to exceed 7.1 billion by the year 2026. A large proportion of these devices are used in smart homes designed for older adults, to help them age in place. Monitoring vitals, climate control, illumination control, fall detection, incontinence detection, pill dispensing, and several other functions are successfully addressed by many of these Bluetooth-enabled devices. Therefore it becomes crucial to protect them from malicious attacks and ensure the safety and well-being of their users. Some of these devices have only Bluetooth connectivity which makes patching them challenging for older adults, as a result, most remain unpatched. The family of vulnerabilities recently found in the Bluetooth Classic (BT Classic) stack called BrakTooth, poses a genuine threat to such devices. In this study, we develop an experimental procedure to capture traffic at the Link Manager Protocol (LMP) layer of the BT Classic stack and use machine learning algorithms to detect BrakTooth-based attacks. © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in modern-day life, such as in smart homes, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the present security measures cannot fully protect the IoT due to its vulnerability to malicious assaults. Intrusion detection can protect IoT devices from the most harmful attacks as a security tool. Nevertheless, the time and detection efficiencies of conventional intrusion detection methods need to be more accurate. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a simple as well as intelligent security framework for protecting IoT from cyber-attacks. For this purpose, a combination of Decisive Red Fox (DRF) Optimization and Descriptive Back Propagated Radial Basis Function (DBRF) classification are developed in the proposed work. The novelty of this work is, a recently developed DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features. Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation parameters. © 2024, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Current research faces a "war"between Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. Despite the shared goal to support the user in his/her choices, researchers seem to be unable to find a common point between the two topics. While one tends to demonstrate that the user needs to have total control of the system he/she is using, the other aims to create mathematical models that automate as much as possible, to give the user the "feeling"that the system has a brain and can think on its own. In the current work, we want to demonstrate that there is more than one possible meeting point between those two research fields, without diminishing the two ideologies. To do so we propose both the adoption of End-User Development techniques (that is a branch of the Human-Computer Interaction) to collect data, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence models, to support the user in performing the right choice. Additionally, we also propose and discuss a couple of scenarios, specifically the programming of internet of things devices in a smart home environment, and check that the related configurations do not expose the user to potential external cyber-attacks. We will not provide any specific solution (with data and/or simulations), rather we want to discuss the potential collaboration between EUD and AI. © 2022 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things technology offers convenience and innovation in areas such as smart homes and smart cities. Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Because many of these IoT devices have access to the Internet and they have little to no security, they make our smart homes highly vulnerable to compromise. Some of the threats include IoT botnets and generic confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) attacks. Our research explores botnet detection by experimenting with supervised machine learning and deep-learning classifiers. Further, our approach assesses classifier performance on unbalanced datasets that contain benign data, mixed in with small amounts of malicious data. We demonstrate that the classifiers can separate malicious activity from benign activity within a small IoT network dataset. The classifiers can also separate malicious activity from benign activity in increasingly larger datasets. Our experiments have demonstrated incremental improvement in results for (1) accuracy, (2) probability of detection, and (3) probability of false alarm. The best performance results include 99.9% accuracy, 99.8% probability of detection, and 0% probability of false alarm. This paper also demonstrates how the performance of these classifiers increases, as IoT training datasets become larger and larger.  © 2020 IEEE.},

IoT devices have security vulnerabilities and cannot completely guarantee data privacy. As is the case with any network, IoT devices are also prone to hacks and Hardware Intrinsic (HI) attacks such as Hardware Trojans (HT), Firmware Modification and Memory Manipulation. The manifestation of HI attack can lead to various types of security issues which includes data theft and denial of service. Traditional HT attack detection techniques are valid for integrated circuit level only, and considered to be very invasive for an IoT device. Therefore, in this paper we propose a non-invasive approach that investigates Hardware Intrinsic Attack Detection in IoT (HIADIoT) devices. This approach detects covert channel and power depletion attacks through the power profile of IoT devices in different modes of operation utilizing machine learning algorithm. The power profile behavior of different IoT devices was observed over a period of time and then preprocessed to serve as data points. These data points is then provided to Random Forest Algorithm which correctly classifies 95.5% of the data point and recognizes potential HI attacks. © 2019 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Identifying IoT devices connected to a network has multiple security benefits, such as deployment of behavior-based anomaly detectors, automated vulnerability patching of specific device types, dynamic attack mitigation, etc. In this paper, we look into the problem of IoT device identification at network level, in particular from an ISP's perspective. The simple solution of deploying a supervised machine learning algorithm at a centralized location in the network neither scales well nor can identify new devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose and develop a distributed device fingerprinting technique (DEFT), a distributed fingerprinting solution that addresses and exploits the presence of common devices, including new devices, across smart homes and enterprises in a network. A DEFT controller develops and maintains classifiers for fingerprinting, while gateways located closer to the IoT devices at homes perform device classification. Importantly, the controller and gateways coordinate to identify new devices in the network. DEFT is designed to be scalable and dynamic - it can be deployed, orchestrated, and controlled using software-defined networking and network function virtualization. DEFT is able to identify new device types automatically, while achieving high accuracy and low false positive rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DEFT by experimenting on data obtained from real-world IoT devices. © 2014 IEEE.},

In addition, advancement in the AI frameworks and libraries brings possibilities to accommodate more AI at the resource-constrained edge of consumer IoT devices. Sensors are nowadays an integral part of our environment which provide continuous data streams to build intelligent applications. An example could be a smart home scenario with multiple interconnected devices. In such smart environments, for convenience and quick access to web-based service and personal information such as calendars, notes, emails, reminders, banking, etc, users link third-party skills or skills from the Amazon store to their smart speakers. Also, in current smart home scenarios, several smart home products such as smart security cameras, video doorbells, smart plugs, smart carbon monoxide monitors, and smart door locks, etc. are interlinked to a modern smart speaker via means of custom skill addition. Since smart speakers are linked to such services and devices via the smart speaker user's account. They can be used by anyone with physical access to the smart speaker via voice commands. If done so, the data privacy, home security and other aspects of the user get compromised. Recently launched, Tensor Cam's AI Camera, Toshiba's Symbio, Facebook's Portal are camera-enabled smart speakers with AI functionalities. Although they are camera-enabled, yet they do not have an authentication scheme in addition to calling out the wake-word. This paper provides an overview of cybersecurity risks faced by smart speaker users due to lack of authentication scheme and discusses the development of a state-of-the-art camera-enabled, microphone array-based modern Alexa smart speaker prototype to address these risks.

However, the security of such connected objects is a real concern due to weak or flawed security designs, configuration errors or imperfect maintenance. Moreover, the vulnerabilities discovered in IoT products are often difficult to eliminate because, most of the time, they cannot be patched easily. Therefore, protection mechanisms are needed to mitigate the potential risks induced by such objects in private and public connected areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect potential attacks in smart places (e.g. smart homes) by detecting deviations from legitimate communication behavior, in particular at the physical layer. The proposed solution is based on the profiling and monitoring of the Radio Signal Strenght Indication (RSSI) associated to the wireless transmissions of the connected objects.

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including smartphones and tablets, are widely deployed in various application domains ranging from smart homes to industrial environments. Many of these devices rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a communication protocol for their control or the transfer of data. Trivial attacks can easily target these devices to compromise them due to their low security features and inherent vulnerabilities in their software and communication components. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack against BLE devices while collecting datasets of network traffic data exchange with and without the attack. Secondly, we study the use of machine learning to detect this attack by combining unsupervised and supervised techniques. We applied and compared two unsupervised techniques to reconstruct the model of BLE communications and detect suspicious data batches. We then applied a classification method based on Text-CNN technique to classify packets as normal or attack inside each suspicious batch. Our model reconstruction results show that we are able to discriminate normal and attack models with high precision and our classification method achieves high accuracy (≈ 0.99 ) and low false positive rate (≈ 0.03 ). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This technology offers attractive services to improve the quality of life as well as new economic markets through the exploitation of the collected data. However, these connected objects have also become attractive targets for attackers because their current security design is often weak or flawed, as illustrated by several vulnerabilities such as Mirai, Blueborne, etc. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting intrusions in smart spaces such as smarthomes, or smartfactories, that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer using machine learning techniques. The approach is designed to be independent of the large and heterogeneous set of wireless communication protocols typically implemented by connected objects such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) or proprietary communication protocols. The main concepts of the proposed approach are presented together with an experimental case study illustrating its feasibility based on data collected during the deployment of the intrusion detection approach in a smart home under real-life conditions. © 2018 IEEE.},

The security of IoT -based systems requires a critical engineering infrastructure when dealing with home security. Any proposed home security framework should establish an automatic access monitoring and regular updates of the system software and firmware according to the ongoing threats. In this paper, we provide an insightful short review of security issues in smart home systems. We highlight several popular IoT protocols and provide critical analysis of their performance against various security threats. Mitigation strategies are also presented to reduce the impact of cyberattacks on smart home systems. Furthermore, our analysis shows that DDoS is one of the most common threats to smart home systems. Therefore, we developed an ML-based model to detect DDoS attacks. We employed unique characteristics of IoT traffic to engineer features that enable ML algorithms to accurately classify DDoS traffic from normal/benign traffic. © 2020 IEEE.},

Security challenges will become an increasingly significant issue, especially in smart homes that depend entirely on IoT devices. Due to the weak infrastructure of the IoT, it is vulnerable to various types of cyber-attacks. The most common IoT attacks are distributed denial of service (DDoS). Most traditional security solutions, like intrusion detection systems (IDS), cannot detect most attacks. Complexity is being hidden by a new paradigm that recently arose, called the software-defined system that is brings a significant change to the networking industry, a great solution for mitigation of attacks that can adopt deep learning technique to encounter cyber-attacks based on the attack behavior and by filtering normal and attack traffic by using well-defined rules. This paper proposed a system by suggesting middleware that can help mitigate or prevent various attacks on IoT on smart home environment. Machine learning has included in the middleware to provide automatic protection against cyber-attacks on IoT networks. A promising approach to protecting real-time, highly accurate attacks on SDN-managed IoT networks has been proposed. This middleware allows IoT devices to efficiently handle evolving security threats dynamically and adaptively without impacting the IoT devices.  © 2021 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Cyber security has become an increasingly important topic in recent years. The increasing popularity of systems and devices such as computers, servers, smartphones, tablets and smart home devices is causing a rapidly increasing attack surface. In addition, there are a variety of security vulnerabilities in software and hardware that make the security situation more complex and unclear. Many of these systems and devices also process personal or secret data and control critical processes in the industry. The need for security is tremendously high. The owners and administrators of modern computer systems are often overwhelmed with the task of securing their systems as the systems become more complex and the attack methods increasingly intelligent. In these days a there are a lot of encryption and hiding techniques available. They are used to make the detection of malicious software with signature based scanning methods very difficult. Therefore, novel methods for the detection of such threats are necessary. This paper examines whether cyber threats can be detected using modern artificial intelligence methods. We develop, describe and test a prototype for windows systems based on neural networks. In particular, an anomaly detection based on autoencoders is used. As this approach has shown, it is possible to detect a wide range of threats using artificial intelligence. Based on the approach in this work, this research topic should be continued to be investigated. Especially cloud-based solutions based on this principle seem to be very promising to protect against modern threats in the world of cyber security. © 2020, Society for Imaging Science and Technology},

IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has infiltrated the digital realm, and critical efforts are being made to create robust security for these technologies. However, with increasingly sophisticated attacks, it is essential to understand IoT device security in depth. We orchestrated Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for four different IoT devices through network flooding to understand the device vulnerabilities from the network level. We conducted our experiment in the lab environment using other IoT devices, including the Amazon Echo, a smart light-bulb, a smart camera, and a smart garage door opener. We used Raspberry Pi as the main target to access other network devices with different protocols to conduct the DoS attack. We generated the DoS attack using Kali Linux installed in a virtual environment. This experiment demonstrated that hackers might exploit sensor vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized network access and use user data through various IoT devices. We proposed an effective Intrusion Detection technique using a combination of machine learning classifiers and deep learning. The machine learning models include logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine to detect and mitigate the attack. The outcomes show the algorithm which presents the highest degree of attack detection accuracy. Our findings also show that DoS attacks continue to be a significant concern even with improved technologies and security protocols. Finally, we provide design implications to address such critical security flaws. © 2021 IEEE.},

At the core of IoT lies the early technology of radio frequency identification (RFID), which provides accurate location tracking of real-world objects. With its small size and convenience, RFID tags can be attached to everyday items such as books, clothes, furniture and the like as well as to animals, plants, and even humans. This phenomenon is the beginning of new applications and services for the industry and consumer market. IoT is regarded as a fourth industrial revolution because of its massive coverage of services around the world from smart homes to artificial intelligence-enabled smart driving cars, Internet-enabled medical equipment, etc. It is estimated that there will be several dozens of billions of IoT devices ready and operating until 2020 around the world. Despite the growing statistics, however, IoT has security vulnerabilities that must be addressed appropriately to avoid causing damage in the future. As such, we mention some fields of study as a future topic at the end of the survey. Consequently, in this comprehensive survey of IoT, we will cover the architecture of IoT with various layered models, security characteristics, potential applications, and related supporting technologies of IoT such as 5G, MEC, cloud, WSN, etc., including the economic perspective of IoT and its future directions. © 2019 KIPS.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly providing people with objects to connect with the physical world, which plays an important role in people's daily life. Although it has brought us great convenience, there are also suffered from security vulnerabilities and potential threats. Currently, the lack of protection mechanisms for IoT devices with limited resources makes it easy to be attacked. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection system to protect the IoT security. The system uses supervised learning to achieve two main functions: (1) classify the generated malicious traffic; (2) identify the types of attacks. Besides, we propose a lightweight feature selection method, which uses a small number of features to evaluate the two functions. As a result, in the classification experiments, the proposed method automatically extracts 29 and 9 from 88 features, and then the designed system achieves a high accuracy rate of 98.7% and 98.99%. This means that our method still has great accuracy by taking a small number of features. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, many examples have shown that such devices may generate new cyber threats causing concerns about the security of sensitive data present in the home environment.

Although, in spite of, being a hot topic to enhance the quality of life, there is no concrete definition of what smart system is and what should be the characteristics of it. Thus, there is a need to identify what these systems actually are and how they can be designed securely. This work firstly attempts to describe attributes related to the smartness to define smart systems. Furthermore, we propose a secure smart system development life cycle, where the security is weaved at all the development phase of smart systems according to principles, guidelines, attack patterns, risk, vulnerability, exploits, and defined rules. Finally, the comparative study is performed for evaluation of traditional security modeling techniques for early assessment of threats and risks in smart systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Given their substantial success in addressing a wide range of computer vision challenges, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in smart home applications, with many of these applications relying on the automatic recognition of human activities. In this context, low-power radar devices have recently gained in popularity as recording sensors, given that the usage of these devices allows mitigating a number of privacy concerns, a key issue when making use of conventional video cameras. Another concern that is often cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these applications against cyberattacks. It is, for instance, well-known that the combination of images and CNNs is vulnerable against adversarial examples, mischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong classifications during testing time. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these radar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through experiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are susceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose the existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to change the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the padding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself occurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation not randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these important features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network interpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial perturbation and prediction interpretability. © 2020 The Authors},

   abstract = {Smart home markets are rapidly growing due to the convenience and comfort they bring to their users. However, smart home appliances are still largely heterogeneous, typically requiring their own applications to control them. This usually means that smart home control remains largely user-driven, making the coordination of heterogeneous devices challenging. Moreover, recent cyber-attacks have demonstrated the vulnerability of many of these devices. Therefore, this paper presents Xenia, a secure smart home platform for management and control of smart home devices. In Xenia, APIs are defined for controlling devices through a centralized server. In addition, the devices can be controlled through text or voice chatting in natural English language. An intelligent agent is developed to give this feature human-like traits. To ensure coordination, the server also implements a graph-based machine learning algorithm to automatically detect user patterns around the house, in order to improve coordination of heterogeneous devices. Finally, a comprehensive security architecture is implemented that provides authentication, access control, encryption, intrusion detection, and firewall services to all parts of the system. Experiments demonstrate the veracity of our system operation. © 2017 IEEE.},

IoT has grown rapidly over the past decade with more than 25 billion devices expected to be connected by 2020. The volume of data released from these devices will increase many-fold in the years to come. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT devices produces a large amount of data with a number of different modalities having varying data quality defined by its speed in terms of time and position dependency. In such an environment, machine learning (ML) algorithms can play an important role in ensuring security and authorization based on biotechnology, anomalous detection to improve the usability, and security of IoT systems. On the other hand, attackers often view learning algorithms to exploit the vulnerabilities in smart IoT-based systems. Motivated from these, in this article, we propose the security of the IoT devices by detecting spam using ML. To achieve this objective, Spam Detection in IoT using Machine Learning framework is proposed. In this framework, five ML models are evaluated using various metrics with a large collection of inputs features sets. Each model computes a spam score by considering the refined input features. This score depicts the trustworthiness of IoT device under various parameters. REFIT Smart Home data set is used for the validation of proposed technique. The results obtained proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other existing schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

This global network is continuously growing with millions of new heterogeneous devices joining cyberspace. The growth is fueled by advancements in both hardware and software technologies such as silicon photonics, cloud computing, internet of things and artificial intelligence. As more devices enter cyberspace, they also increase the attack surface and ultimately rendering the entire network vulnerable. Management of these systems by humans will not be feasible due to massive scale, heterogeneity, and software complexity. For a healthy cyberspace, we also need autonomous defense systems that can learn, adapt and defend against emerging threats. Using the principles of cybernetics, we present an autonomous network security operations model. We apply this model to three different kinds of environment.

   abstract = {IoT (Internet of things) devices have become integral parts of our everyday life to function especially in smart homes/offices/cities. However, their huge varieties and scales make it hard to manage the security and the quality of services of IoT networks with generic policies. Furthermore, IoT devices owned by employees can unknowingly endanger the security and integrity of the network from other IoT entities they are connected to. Fortunately, IoT devices of the same type tend to have similar vulnerabilities making attack prevention more manageable. Thus, identifying the device types is crucial for IoT security. This paper presents an approach to building a classifier to identify different types of IoT devices using various machine learning techniques. While most existing empirical studies use network traffic data, we use communication protocol data. The paper describes the data collection/treatment, the experiments using four machine learning techniques and compares our proposed approach with an existing work based on the Jaccard similarity measure. The results show that both approaches have competitive accuracy of up to 99% but the Jaccard approach does not scale well (e.g., about 1000 times more than the training time of our approach).  © 2021 IEEE.},

In IoT-based environment, communication protocol of IoT category and lightweight special environment software are used instead of universal network configuration.

Because of the rapid growth of IoT equipment and the expectation that there will be a sharp increase in the need to identify facts about vulnerabilities and improper use associated with IoT services naturally. It is necessary to apply artificial intelligence technology for classification and automatic collection and analysis of IoT vulnerabilities for wearable devices and smart home devices through artificial intelligence analysis technology.

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been erupting the world widely over the decade. Smart home and smart building owners are increasingly deploying IoT devices to monitor and control their environments due to the rapid decline in the price of IoT devices. The recent intensive research has shown that network traffic traces of IoT devices have significant cybersecurity and privacy issues. These security and privacy defending techniques have enabled sophisticated approaches to ensure security and preserve user privacy. However, due to the fact that different approaches are evaluated using their own datasets, their own developed security and privacy attack models, and their own evaluating metrics, it is being significantly difficult to make a fair and comprehensive comparisons among different IoT security strengthening and user privacy preserving research to better understand IoT security issues and end-user benefits. To address this problem, we present a deep learning-based adversarial attack model framework-SmartAttack, which enables a set of sophisticated adversarial attack models that can be leveraged by researchers and industrial users from IoT security community to better evaluate their work. In essence, we leverage the most widely used unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models to design and implement these attack models. SmartAttack also provides user options to select the detailed configuration for each attack model, such as kernel, dataset splitting, cross-validation states, and evaluating metrics. We also evaluate the performance of SmartAttack using two different datasets. In addition, we made the source codes and the related datasets of SmartAttack publicly-available on our research website such that researchers can use our SmartAttack to benchmark their security strengthening and privacy-preserving approaches.  © 2020 IEEE.},

   abstract = {With the increasing number and variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices supporting a wide range of services such as smart homes, smart transportation, and smart factories in smart cities, malware carrying various cybersecurity threats are rapidly increasing in terms of type and number. To protect IoT devices from cyberattacks, studies on malware detection using artificial intelligence are being conducted. However, with the emergence of IoT malware and their various evasion techniques, the probability of falsely detecting malware as benign is also increasing. In this study, we propose a two-stage hybrid malware detection (2-MaD) scheme for the protection of IoT devices from obfuscated malware in a smart city setting. The 2-MaD consists of two stages of IoT malware detection. First, after performing static analysis, the opcode is extracted, and using the learned information through a bidirectional long short-term memory model, benign files are detected. In the next stage, a dynamic analysis is performed on files classified as benign in a nested virtual environment. After extracting information on behavior and process memory from the behavior log based on system changes, malware can be detected through the trained EfficientNet-B3 model. © 2021,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences.All Rights Reserved},

   abstract = {The ability to sense the environment is the cornerstone of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a rapidly expanding paradigm that is altering the way we interact with machines. IoT enables a range of new services to enhance the lives of endusers. One of these services concerns activity recognition within Ambient Assisted Living which can be used to help people live independently at home for longer. Many of these applications can, however, be prone to failure and vulnerable to attack. Extensive research is therefore required to build towards a secure and sustainable IoT. This work examines activity recognition in a smart home environment using three different classifiers on a well-known activity recognition dataset. Fail-dirty and device shut-down data is introduced in the dataset to examine the impact that this erroneous data has on the application. This study found that it was possible to rank the importance of sensors with regards to their influence on classification by observing how these failures impacted the classifiers when compared to the fmeasure produced from the classification of the clean data. This work also found that while representing data in a binary format obtains higher accuracy, it makes the classifier considerably more vulnerable to dirty data. Lastly, this study found that decision tree classifiers have an inherent vulnerability when it comes to handling dirty data, resulting in a 24% reduction in performance versus the clean data, due to the structuring and placement of leaf nodes in the tree. © 2019 IEEE.},

The primary security challenge to develop a methodology to identify a malicious activity correctly and mitigate the impact of such activity promptly. In this paper, we propose a two-level anomalous activity detection model for intrusion detection system in IoT networks. The level-1 model categorizes the network flow as normal flow or abnormal flow, while the level-2 model classifies the category or subcategory of detected malicious activity. When the network flow classified as an anomaly by the level-1 model, then the level-1 model forwards the stream to the level-2 model for further investigation to find the category or subcategory of the detected anomaly. Our proposed model constructed on flow-based features of the IoT network. Flow-based detection methodologies only inspect packet headers to classify the network traffic. Flow-based features extracted from the IoT Botnet dataset and various machine learning algorithms were investigated and tested via different cross-fold validation tests to select the best algorithm. The decision tree classifier yielded the highest predictive results for level-1, and the random forest classifier produced the highest predictive results for level-2. Our proposed model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score for level-1 were measured as 99.99% and 99.90% for level-2. A two-level anomalous activity detection system for IoT networks we proposed will provide a robust framework for the development of malicious activity detection system for IoT networks. It would be of interest to researchers in academia and industry. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Integration of the Internet into the entities of the different domains of human society (such as smart homes, health care, smart grids, manufacturing processes, product supply chains, and environmental monitoring) is emerging as a new paradigm called the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ubiquitous and wide-range IoT networks make them prone to cyberattacks. One of the main types of attack is a denial of service (DoS), where the attacker floods the network with a large volume of data to prevent nodes from using the services. An intrusion detection mechanism is considered a chief source of protection for information and communications technology. However, conventional intrusion detection methods need to be modified and improved for application to the IoT owing to certain limitations, such as resource-constrained devices, the limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and specific protocol stacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing a supervised machine learning-based support vector machine (SVM) to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier, aided by a combination of two or three incomplex features, can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing with the advancement of technology. Many vendors are creating IoT devices to leverage the quality of life of consumers. These devices include smart grids, smart homes, smart health care systems, smart transportation, and many other applications. IoT devices interact with the environment and each other using sensors and actuators. However, the widespread proliferation of IoT devices poses many cybersecurity threats. The IoT devices' interconnection opens the door to attackers who try to gain unauthorized access to these devices. For many IT networks, establishing trust and security during the device operation is challenging. Further, devices also may leak vital information, which is a significant concern in cybersecurity. Prior research has shown that security breaches have increased by 67% over the past five years, and 95% of HTTPs servers are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MIM) attacks. This paper examines attack datasets from the Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab (HCRL) collected from real-life IoT devices that include smart cameras, laptops, and smartphones [1]. We present a model using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. Results indicate that the overall detection accuracy is 98-100%, which is more promising than traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). © 2020 IEEE.},

   abstract = {At present, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays very important role in communication system by facilitating services in the form of smart city, smart home, smart transportation, etc. These wide range of applications are collected, computed and provided by thousands of IoT devices placed in open spaces. Everyday these highly interconnected heterogeneous IoT devices face new attacks. Common security platforms are not suitable to manage these complex platforms because communication stacks and protocols of each type of devices are different from other types. Therefore, it seems important to study about security issues relating to several attacks and vulnerabilities. In this paper, IoT security issues and challenges are discussed in a systematic way to protect the devices from vulnerabilities and to strengthen the idea of the researchers in this direction.},

   abstract = {With the large-scale use of ZigBee technology in industry and smart home system, the security problems of ZigBee emerge gradually. And people pay more and more attention to ZigBee security. In view of the lack of a mature Zig-Bee attack detection product in the market, this paper will research on ZigBee and design a simple ZigBee attack detection system. First, according to some internal operation mechanisms of ZigBee protocol, we analyze the potential attack threats on ZigBee during its operation, and propose four specific attacks including association attack, replay attack, network PANID conflict attack and malicious orphan frame attack. Then we propose corresponding detection schemes for those four attacks. Besides, we point out two possible vulnerabilities in ZigBee Network: network short address conflict vulnerability and association table vulnerability. Finally, we design a ZigBee attack detection system which is divided into three parts: device scanning module, attack detection module and vulnerability detection module. The system has the characteristics of rapid deployment and rapid detection. It can meet some simple security requirements of a ZigBee application scene.},
